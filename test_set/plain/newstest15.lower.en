this is perfectly illustrated by the ukip numbties banning people with hiv.
you mean nigel farage saying the nhs should not be used to pay for people coming to the uk as health tourists, and saying yes when the interviewer specifically asked if, with the aforementioned in mind, people with hiv were included in not being welcome.
you raise a straw man and then knock it down with thinly veiled homophobia.
every time i or my family need to use the nhs we have to queue up behind bigots with a sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.
i think the straw man is yours.
health tourism as defined by the right wing loonies is virtually none existent.
i think it's called democracy.
so no one would be affected by ukip's policies against health tourism so no problem.
only in ukip la la land could carswell be described as revolutionary.
quoting the bollox the daily muck spew out is not evidence.
ah, shoot the messenger.
the mail didn't write the report, it merely commented on it.
whoever controls most of the media in this country should undead be shot for spouting populist propaganda as fact.
i don't think you know what a straw man is.
you also don't know anything about my personal circumstances or identity so i would be very careful about trying to eradicate a debate with accusations of homophobia.
farage's comment came as quite a shock, but only because it is so rarely addressed.
he did not express any homophobic beliefs whatsoever.
you will just have to find a way of getting over it.
i'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say, but my guess is that you dislike the media reporting things you disagree with.
it is so rarely addressed because unlike fararge and his thatcherite loony disciples who think aids and floods are a signal from the divine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding the complexities of humanity as something to celebrate,then no.
in the end the situation is just as bad in ireland as it is in spain.
with the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.
hoping for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a real joke.
ireland, the "european tiger" they used to speak highly of to us years ago.
we know the rest!
it is starting again when you read this article.
they're trying to pretend that ireland is a virtuous country and that a "new economic miracle" is happening.
with the agreement of brussels, the lowest taxes on companies in europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing emigration.
with these ingredients, there is nothing to "crow about" for the time being with the arrival of the poles.
in the 80s in the twentieth century, ireland was one of the poorest countries in the european union, along with portugal. considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it ever was.
greece was ahead.
it is clear that their development was not a long quiet river, given the recent events.
the lowest taxes in europe?
that is not correct!
latvia has a 0% tax rate for companies.
now there is real hypocrisy in france from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay.
if we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they generally pay less than 5% in france.
only smes pay the full lot.
now i confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, exactly like before the 2008 crisis.
i have lived in dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams from when the schools go back.
this is business news?
don't worry, i'm sure the comments section will take off soon.
in another article they're drafting now, there were 2 vauxhaul astra's involved in a fender bender on the a140.
is this how ryanair now plan for passengers to transfer flights?
gather mr o'leary is buying a whole new fleet of planes soon so a few bumps and scratches on his old ones will soon be forgotten.
mind you i'm flying with him next week so hope it won't be on one of these two after they've been patched up.
that'll be all the other pilot's fault then.
did ryanair charge the passengers for the extra fear they were supplied with?
only for irish companies like this you couldn't afford to go on hols young man
i've never flown ryanair and the last 3 times i flew i went ba.
i prefer my airlines to offer me customer service.
no, but its ryanair, so they can have a pop.
any article about ryanair attracts dozens of comments from people who would never fly ryanair, to those who like flying ryanair and think anyone paying anything more than the basic fare has only themselves to blame, etc.
it's pretty transparent.
ryanair are not going to be happy about the extra cost involved in this incident.
i wonder how long the delays will be and will compensation to passengers by due and if so, can ryanair then get out of paying as they can say it was the airport air traffic controllers error.
pax were on a different aircraft within an hour, no compo due.
sorry to disappoint you and your compo state of mind.
you're all welcome on board this british airways flight bringing british isis to syria, init as you say.
enjoy the ride
last sunday in paris, rue des francs-bourgeois: le marais is largely pedestrianized, and is literally swarming with people.
the people have not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (ordinary, for the most part) or for the journal fair at the espace des blancs-manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly outmoded).
the reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the area is incredibly lively and animated.
with a lot of foreigners who spend...
do you think that opening on sundays is going to create jobs?
go to paris rue des francs bourgeois where the shops are open on sunday, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes false!
the only argument that would seem admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign tourists and this is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax-free.
tourist areas lose a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons.
the industry remains, where expensive equipment, used on sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.
sunday rest is a right that employees, besides exceptions, enjoy.
that's the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code.
neither the ministry responsible for the economy, nor, moreover, the one responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labor code.
so they should shut up.
what use is the law?
to satisfy a part of the population and the companies who want to work on sunday.
in montreal on sunday afternoon, i take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
in my town with 30,000 inhabitants where i live in france, the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not at the weekend!
that is access to culture...
and that is also the regulation of working times.
the way of life that he defended so tenaciously against fascism
the way of life that he defended so tenaciously against fascism and bolshevism
how about the estate of his daughter, despite her will, is simply told to pay up on iht?
they are paintings.
some ok, some poor.
doubtless the estate would want their pound of flesh so to speak.
his preference for the nationalists/franco winning the spanish civil war..
and his antipathy towards independence for places like ireland and india and his overall fascist view and throw in his well known hatred of the jews.
churchill wasn't perfect.
neither am i.
but for 5 years, and five years only mind, he was perfect.
he stood against his fellow aristos in government in 1940 who wanted to discuss ' terms' with the nazis and very cleverly saw them off.
by dint of his magnificent oratory and energy he brought this country together to understand that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
the people of the uk , and france, and belgium and ultimately the rest of the world can thank god, that for those five years, just those five years, churchill was at the helm, and no other.
the greatness of churchill is irrelevant to this debate.
let his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise the money for iht, they might even make a profit.
if the public want any of them on display in a museum, they can raise the money and buy them.
it really is that simple.
but we could use the tax money.
no denying that "cometh the day" churchill's personality was a positive benefit to his country in ww11.
a relaunch of the internal market by public works will only favor large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, the infrastructure sites by definition are not very renewable.
as for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the true french difficulty, distrust of dialogue.
return to the first values.
an unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
the weakest among us should not be in need!
we either come to their assistance in solidarity, or they are entitled, in exchange for the services that they provide or provided, to a minimum of resources.
the sm40h that i prefer to the minimum wage corresponds to this vision.
there is also the lessor who lives off the revenue from his properties.
there is room to differentiate between someone who invests for a return when they retire and someone who lives off their income.
a property to rent, or even two for a couple, above is a vice
the little finance genius is extremely lacking in imagination.
the new deal was a policy for major projects, but at a time with a lack of major infrastructure.
today, in europe and in france, this is not the case.
the developed countries are over-equipped.
the need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore in no way would a new deal be a solution.
above all at a time when the question of decline is emerging in response to a recession which is only a wild decline, therefore brutal
you would have been right 30 years ago: greater need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, motorways...
but if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
a tax system which favors high incomes and people of independent means.
who is in power?
obsessed with smartphones.
charles arthur is such a scamp.
iphone 6 and budget rivals hit samsung profits
apple’s introduction of the larger-screened iphone 6 and 6 plus in mid-september may have lured some would-be galaxy buyers away
i tested all those phones and decided on the lg g3.
so samsung lost me as a customer, but not to apple.
i think it is vital that we have alternatives.
when microsoft instituted this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by google, apple and the opensource community.
we need several thriving platforms, to spur competition and development.
we also have completely different requirements and these cannot be satisfied by any one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
for myself, i tend to buy apple, because i like the underlying philosophy and appreciate design.
some people are completely unaffected by design, they value features, functionality and price.
there is nothing wrong with that.
let's get away from the mentality of seeking "one best platform".
is there a "one best car manufacturer", not really, they are different, yet similar.
i would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
this is healthy and needs to be encouraged.
it is in our collective interest to do so.
i am happy that you found exactly what you where looking for and that it is not an apple product, even though i myself made a different choice.
most people i know have iphones.
could our friends from the ump who, according to one of them, combat ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course the parisian bohos) tell us which author's/s' ideas on gender they are combating and specify exactly which works that they are intending to combat.
or do they just attack gender as described in le figaro, minute or valeurs actuelles?
are their sources judith butler or eric zemmour?
well, jean, i like you a lot, and you are someone who is intelligent and cultured.
i said that about judith in the vein of furusato evoking holofernes, a parallel which did not occur to me (i do not have her sharpness of mind).
otherwise, all things considered, as you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and, sincerely, i cannot see where the problem is: i would hope that you and your friends could get me out of my retardation, as i am slow but i understand well...
@ jean: recognize that, culturally, sending judith back to holofernes, that does it.
who is scared asks le monde?
but what do those who are scared fear?
furasato and @ give us some answers.
the first by referring to judith from the bible, the second by describing judith butler as a very symbolic throat slicer.
we can see how these studies affect the most intimate parts of them.
we are clearly no longer in the debate of ideas
this is something else, much deeper.
@ jean, have you read that le monde published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: as it was about a debate of ideas, i thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
intending to combat ideas from the only report that their critics make of it (cardinal ratzinger, inventor of the gender theory, or x lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
but anyway, as i was explaining to our friend from the ump, that is the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
i am not sure, however, that he has understood the nuance.
i have not read judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, i was pleased with the "second sex" (it is more from my time), which i believe is the source of "the source", according to lo's wishes.
as i was viewing the eclipse from melbourne, i saw flashes of red colour as the moon briefly revealed itself when the clouds parted.
this sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm, and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of clouds completely blocking the view at times.
it was fab here in fnq.
yes, last night's cloud was very much hugging the coast of victoria and nsw, while much of the rest of australia was clear.
news flash blood moon.
tony abbott / joe hockey blames labor.
but if labor agrees to our unfair budget we will restore it to it's correct colour as soon as possible.
obsessed, much?
i was in melbourne so naturally i saw nothing but clouds.
melbourne also managed to cloud over for the entire week of the perseid meteor shower and for practically every major astronomical phenomenon in the last few years.
i'm starting to think there's a gremlin whose sole job is to stop melbourne residents from seeing anything of the sky.
melbourne definitely isn't the best site for an observatory, although things get much better on the other side of the dividing range.
there were stretches of 10-20 mins where i couldn't see the eclipse due to clouds over suburban melbourne.
im putting a tax on this eclipse.
anyone looking at this eclipse will be taxed.
i bet abbott is your first waking thought, and your last each night.
what / whom will you obsess with when he's (inevitably) gone?
you seem to have spent quite some time going through threads, searching for posts in which people are negative about the abbott government and then accusing them of being obsessed.
great photo of the moon over the sydney harbour bridge.
it looks like mars is heading for a collision with earth!
nothing about share and property speculation.
nothing about inequalities between income from work and from capital.
nothing about tax fraud.
ultra liberalism is in the processing of killing europe.
nothing about the gardens of babylon...
the article says too much or not enough about it.
the detail and the arguments of these recommendations are not given.
no hyperlink to the original documents so that one can form an opinion.
go and look today, tuesday 15 october, at the results of the miracle recipes: in spain, exports are at their lowest for five years.
in greece the stock market is collapsing.
nevertheless, it seems that these are the examples to follow.
the notary reform would generate a claim for compensation in the region of 8 billion euros.
the minister of the economy claims that these claims for compensation are not well-founded.
what if there is an error by the ministry of the economy?
will the decision-makers, having raked in the political profit resulting from the the notaries' courageous attack, have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
the continuation in its own time.
ok, thank you, jyl....
@lol no, the state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of their budget, as the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite, while that of the household is confined by the lifetime of its members.
moreover, unless considering that public spending is unproductive, they contribute towards funding tangible and intangible investments, guarantees of future growth and, therefore, future solutions.
some answers.
a regrettable decision.
but remember the sacred hippocratic oath: the health of the global pharmaceutical companies' bottom line must be preserved above all else.
nice conspiracy theory.
unfortunately the truth is different from your delusion.
the medical staff would like to administer it, but are hamstrung by the law as determined by the politicians.
it's the same situation as for the drug to medically induce abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe injecting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets etc.
the politicians pander to the uneducated masses on these issues.
by the way, doctors do not make money from drugs.
that's why pharmacists exist.
doctors do not make money from drugs considering the liberals want to transform our medical system into the us system, you need to read up on how it works.
doctors are courted similarly world-wide, but with different degrees of visibility.
the op may have phrased it poorly with blame on the medicos side, but reality is that many countries, australia included, give preference to company profits and "research".
read up on the relatively few reports on our pbs costs and negotiations with the drug companies as compared to other countries.
compare world-wide prices of drugs, that are all over the place, as well as the differences on what is otc versus script only from country to country.
that reinforces it is a political and business process, not a medical or scientific process, whether direct or indirect.
actually there are companies running trials on marijuana sprays for oncology pain right now, despite onerous and inhibiting laws and permits being required.
while manufacturers of certain drugs might not be happy about alternatives such as marijuana being used, those who can get a version that delivers good quality product in known doses, will do quite nicely out of it.
sorry to say this miss but your call is off, there is much going on behind the scenes when it comes to dr's and pharmacy.
as for this hospital, they were happy feeding the oil until someone had a "whisper" in the ear of an exec of said hospital.
cant own patents on weed..
if social sciences "researchers" did research instead of politics or networking, perhaps we could use their "work".
a researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact with another.
comparing is not researching.
comparing is teaching not researching.
it is not possible to say "the research succeeded, it must be applied" and then in the same breath "it must be tested out excessively".
if you research succeeded, why test it out?
if your research did not succeed, why do you ask that they are applied?
can you explain to me how a piece of "research" can conclude that a pupil who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
new technology makes it possible to learn provided that pupils learn to use new technology, but how do they manage to learn the new technology if they do not know how to learn?
the pisa tests are only an indicator. let's make an indicator which enables us to find indicators which are satisfactory for us.
what is the purpose of building an indicator which informs you of what is convenient to you, a wish for self-promotion, deception?
a single track for training teachers: move sophists and ideologues away from the training and let practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice reread the paragraph on placements (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us towards the most ineffective conservatism: "it is a device which leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not enable the system to make progress".
given the general consensus on the state of the french system, we cannot wish that only the practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
education theorists must not have any place.
practitioners must have one.
would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating theatre before?
there is no consensus about the causes of the problems of the education system.
giving more weight to education theorists would mean destroying it permanently.
your analogy is totally flawed: if i would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who only has theoretical training, i would like to be operated on even less by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who learnt on the job.
mike weatherley, the tory mp placed in charge of tackling copyright infringement by david cameron
why doesn't he just tell cameron to stop doing it ?
someone should make a citizens arrest.
lol exmaiers thanks for that.
if i ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement i just need to read an article like this.
in an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
just the same as they are required to properly reference sources.
in many cases it costs nothing to properly licence content.
no, it's copyright infringement.
not the same thing at all.
when you use content without properly licensing it you are depriving the artists of their living.
you can argue the pedantic ifs and buts to justify yourself - but it's theft.
and you can say it is often as you want, but that won't make it true.
it's copyright infringement.
go on, say it again.
if i ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
you're clearly comfortable depriving artists of their income.
if they think they should get money for images used in school reports, an almost perfect definition of what should be fair use, then i'm happy to deprive them of this ficticious income.
lesson 1 should be to show how if the children themselves come up with any content and publish it on their favourite social media sites, then they give away any ip to the site according to the t&c's they clicked through.
perhaps if they share an earphone connected to a mp3 player with a friend on the school bus they should be expelled for such disregard of the law.
ah if only we could export this resource which we are overflowing with, the complainer who says that everything is going badly...
if a ps member of parliament states this, then we have to believe it.
i have 2 children and when they are at an age to choose, i will advise them to leave france if nothing has changed by then.
france drags everyone down by assisting them continually.
i do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
what drags france down are speeches like yours.
@gus i have worked in a private company forever.
i was lucky to have worked in companies managed by excellent business leaders: it does exist in france, but it is rare.
i am an employee because i know that i do not have the skills to manage a company and this choice enables me to lay into hopeless bosses, who i come across frequently.
feeling very comfortable, i fully share jean-pierre bernajuzan's post: he is telling the horrible truth!
@gus, if we make a comparison with german companies, the french business leaders are constantly quoted as demanding reforms in france, while in germany, companies knew how to structure their industrial framework to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large, medium and small companies. what are french bosses waiting for to do the same??
for the state to hold their hand?
this state which accuses them of being incompetent?
@ jacques l.
always this anti-business leader verse from you!
remind me, what have you created in terms of jobs, in added value, to be so harsh?
@ pat i understand your reaction.
in fact, france is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of french business leaders incapable of creating jobs and who sulk and simper waiting for the permanent help from the state!
it's terrible!
but they do have some solutions: abolition of the labor code, employer contributions, taxes, working 45hours/week paid for 35, and some, walking on egg shells, dare to call for the reduction of salaries if not their abolition!
just waiting for all the "negative" comments about this.
which will be ironic given how people always complain about first group.
as far as i can see from a distance last have hardly been an investment for us taxpayers.
they have been a steady as she goes operation, rather than transformative.
that is not to say that there have not been improvements to railways in scotland while last were running the services.
however, there were improvements to railways in scotland with their predecessors too, including british rail.
we haven't got the powes to do that, alas.
tried to get them recently but it didn't work.
still, labour will sort that out for us, won't they...
it's an international spin-off company.
they already operate trains in germany.
there's nothing stopping people in the uk creating a company with ethics and bidding for contracts.
but we seem to have a problem with running things, few of our privatised services have ended up being uk run.
i just remember the uproar and criticism when the virgin contract went to first, only for the decision to be cancelled.
it gets better, mtr, a hong kong company has won the contract to operate crossrail for 8 years.
well labour, as they told us repeatedly during the referendum campaign, are all in favour of pooling and sharing, and think the working people should all stick together without borders.
presumably they will therefore be pleased at this decision ;)
perhaps that's because the dutch have a track record (literally) for running railways well and the british don't.
it's not simply a change of ownership scotrail needs but some new ideas.
abellio may be the least bad choice available but the real problem is the ludicrous franchising system, not the franchiser.
"she was a fighter".
sir, i hate, i really hate this type of expression.
assuming that the fact of being a "fighter" is a quality more superior to many others, the worry of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being a "fighter" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer patients who are "fighters", who are nevertheless not dead, i know loads of them.
overcoming a disease is nothing to do with merit.
come on let's start over again..
i'm not saying that it's the condition to cure, i'm saying that it helps..
nothing to do with any merit...!
as for the examples from your life, only you can judge them.
i'll start over.
to insinuate, if only for a moment, that one can deserve to get over an illness or that one can not deserve to get over it, is quite simply monstrous.
the body follows or it does not follow.
a body which lets go, all over, in spite of will, in spite of confidence in the medicine, do you have the vaguest idea of what that means?
sorry to think the opposite, if, having a strong morale enables one to accept tough treatments more easily and to prepare oneself for them, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them because of fear...
someone who is fighting in medicine, is above all someone who trusts medicine...
but if one prefers to leave it up to the "lord", that's something else...
neither with merit nor with courage.
these considerations are characteristic of moralists.
when you catch a bug, a real one, you strip yourself of everything to the point of only becoming a zombie.
personally, i've caught two of them, bugs, big ones, and i "fought", as these fine psychologists say, that completely escaped my mind.
at least this combat only consists of gritting one's teeth, suffering like hell and taking the punches.
i thought the case against milosevic was decided and finalized about 10 years ago.
i haven't seen the man's name in print in at least that long.
what's going on?
it's an anniversary.
a forgotten one.
his trial was brought to an end "swiftly" and then swept under the carpet.
was this the story that was told back then?
communist-turned-nationalist who ignited three balkan wars in the past decade?
communist president of a socialist federal republic of yugoslavia?
please, question the facts that are conveniently missed out: 1.
explain how nato bombing was legal under any norms of international law.
what country did serbia attack?
when talking about rts (radio-television-serbia) why do you fail to mention how nato blew up that same building killing civilians and then deemed it a valid target.
milosevic was done however one flips the coin: if he didn't defend his country against nato attack he would get crucified as a traitor.
if he did, he would get eaten up by western justice system.
westerners deemed false flag and detached part of a sovereign state witch later unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was expressly recognized by western states who proceeded to flat out lie about situation on the ground.
serbian population now is non existent (ethnically cleansing).
vojislav kostunica who here is mentioned, politically died after his first term after failing to comprehend situation that had developed.
zoran djindjic was one of most controversial figures in politics of that time.
in the end, guardian staff should not call milosevic a tyrant (as much as he was not popular among us).
as far as i know, only in greece is there an earthquake prediction method that works more or less, by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
this type of study is indisputably useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
a hope therefore, but caution should be exercised. this water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named hat-p-11b, located about 124 light years away from earth in the cygnus constellation, which is "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study led by drake deming and jonathan fraine's team from the university of maryland.
the method to be followed then.
just like those which involve animals feeling threatened.
thank you passeur de sciences for treating us, often, to these experimental feats which are achieved in the world.
how would animals know (in advance)?
undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
like radon, for example.
an odorless gas a priori for man but may be detected by animals.
all these methods are undetectable by man, but not for the measuring instruments which they have at their disposal.
but we do not have reliable results on these clues...
it was observed many a time (and for centuries) that certain animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake, particularly hens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
i had seen a report on the arte channel telling of the fight of two scientific teams, one californian, the other japanese, to ensure the recognition of the validity of their work which was about animals' sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly about their modification before an earthquake.
well of course i am not a scientist, but their hypotheses had convinced me!
how far have we got on this research?
why so much contempt towards this line of research?
we should learn how to listen to nature again...
if one examines things calmly and rigorously, one publishes it in a serious journal, and no one looks down on it.
as soon as we talk about "signs" given by animals, we come up against the same slant: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was strangely going round in circles.
i don't understand why anyone thinks boris will make a good tory leader.
he has over reached himself as london major.
listening to the lbc phone-in and you can't help but thinking this man hasn't got a clue and is always desperate to distract you with a joke.
he never gives a straight answer to anything.
another point he said was that he agreed with farage, then nick ferrari the presenter asked what he agreed on?
he couldn't name a single thing.
he made so many pledges to get elected as major and hasn't kept any.
simply underlines what a crock of sh1t the rest of the t party are doesn't it?
because he's popular.
because he's funny.
he's been on have i got news for you.
because he's a celebrity and the people have been trained to worship celebrities.
londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
when (not if) he takes over as leader, the tories poll ratings will go through the roof i'm certain.
god help us.
i am not so sure - the public love a joke but don't necessarily want one for pm
that's exactly what they said about londoners.
should have taken his smarter friend the house brick with him
in many ways, i think he's modelled himself on one r branson
the americans had one for a president.
the french are really and always uninterested in the history of the pacific war.
for all those who have bothered to read some books on it (they do exist, including one in french and an excellent one by b.
millot), the "solomon" and the "iron bottom sound" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remain there.
it is understandable that the australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the australia, must still be at the bottom since the battle of savo), do not want to return there.
we actually went past the island of savo, in the "iron bottom sound".
even if the mission is coming to an end.
well done kids.
but the ecological side is a complete smoke screen.
calculating the kerozene consumed to reach the target totally undermines the concept...
it is enough to go through the list of sponsors. only philanthropists.
another communication plan that is no longer done nor should be done.
blimey, it makes you want to so much!!!
i am waiting for the web series impatiently!
your story makes me dream, by identifying myself a little in passing (i also learnt to sail with the crocodiles de l'elorn in the white mill in brest harbor!).
well done also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the journey.
the end justifies the means.
continue to make us dream, and to show us with pride that the bretons are great travelers!
pierre, from trinidad and tobago.
good evening. i think that the extremist who protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the brittany region and the city of brest.
more seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to funding the dreams of some adventurers, even those as nice as those ones!
is there any players in the current serbian set up of kosovan descent?
i know lyon's dusan bajevic and milos krasic, late of juventus and now at fenerbache, are from mitrovica but don't know if they're still involved in the squad
bisevac is lyon's defender not bajevic.
bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s, and coach of many teams in greece, but i dunno where from.
bajevic is from mostar, bosnia & herzegovina, and played as a striker for the great velez side that, under the tutelage of the legendary suleman rebac, twice finished as runners-up in the yugoslav league (and also included such luminaries as vahid halilhodzic and arsene wenger's trusty side-kick boro primorac).
why, thanks mole!
i sure know who halihodzic and primorac are.
just out of interest, what happened to krasic?
he was tipped to be the next big thing whilst at juve and that he is currently in turkey but the last time he appeared on my radar he was being linked with blackburn *shudder*
can't help you there.
i know he lost his place when conte arrived, then he moved to fener, and as far as i know he isn't regular there.
there might be one more move in him, perhaps indian super league?
come on serbia.
come on albania ' don't be afraid.
you should love albania because you are neighbours.
the thing is, the flag in that dron wasn't the flag of the actua, current albania.
it was apparently the flag of greater albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant presence of albanians.
a bit of excessive nationalism, basically.
thankfully, there were no significant casualties (that i know of).
actually, it was the albanian flag shaped like the map of not the so-called greater albania, but of albania before 1913, when the european great powers decided do give give parts of the country to the neighbour countries.
how can one have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children were inside?
how??
what bothers me a little in this "account", is the mere fact of having been able to, even if it was just once, be spontaneously delighted at the horrible death of thousands of people; in my eyes it bears witness to a "border line" personality, all the "accounts" of whom should be taken with the highest circumspection.
no doubt that in the short moment of "joy", one will not have thought of the dead nor the reality of the horror inflicted.
one will have only thought, for one instant, that, for once, muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalyptically hurting the big bad satan in his heart itself.
doing something powerful.
something grand.
it would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of muslims consumed by their feeling of humiliation.
with accounts filmed in palestine.
classic schadenfreude.
we had some doubts.
the west "christian/white/gauls" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the muslim when he contemplates the general poverty, social and cultural under-development of the arab-muslim world today.
i'm talking about the suburbs of cairo or algiers, not the towers of dubai.
the former splendor, certainly glorified is no consolation, on the contrary.
how can the muslim world get out of this diabolical hole?
entirely in agreement, 2 major poisons run through the arab world i: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in authority and fascistic nihilism.
the thing in common, the suspension of thought and the excommunication (gentle or armed) of their critical expression.
as may have been understood before, do not make the muslims retreat.
this is the only way.
has edwy plenel read this article?
in many countries i suspect that's true.
but in britain autumn is the start of six long wet miserable dark months which affect many people's well being and mood.
every one gets ill, too.
seasonal affective disorder.
i suffer from it myself.
when that light starts to go its hell for me and those like me.
a dose of vitamin d should help with some of the mood and well being issues.
autumn in britain is beautiful, with or without the rain.
the countryside especially is breathtaking in autumn.
not as breathtaking as summer greenery when everything is alive instead of being on the verge of death.
in britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
we had a great summer this year, don't be a cliche parroting grump!
not everyone.
i seldom get ill in winter.
however now im retired and no longer developing immunity to germs in the wider world, that may change i guess.
it's not the verge of death it's just one point in a cycle...
a gloriously fruity point with lots of intoxicating smells, a build up of excitement to festivals like halloween, guy fawks, christmas, the possibilities of getting snowed in and various other wonderfully waffley words.
just don't stop doing stuff!
one festive wreath of recommends heading your way.
yes, those dark and gray months do indeed make me much happier and more relaxed.
for the taxation on the increases for children, it is the amount collected by the state which essentially originates from deciles 8 to 10.
but concerning the number of households which have seen their taxes increase following this measures, the fourth and fifth deciles (median incomes) are those concerned above all according to diagram 2.
the abolition of the half-share concerning above all widows was not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact was completely under estimated: 230 million euros is a joke which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
and it's not about to improve.
well, we are not penniless of course, but pensive
if for once the ps makes a policy that is left-leaning instead, we're not going to cry...
it is clear that those who make up the 20% richest must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
continue like this and you will encourage this 20% to work less or to leave.
well, i know, it's not politically correct, but i'm saying it anyway.
long live the trotskyists and the ocis recycled in the ps: they understood everything.
adam, you see badly what you are looking at.
the proportion is always the same, here or in bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
fair taxes is when it stops anyone from amassing as much as they can.
beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
and once the usefulness of money has been exceeded, money is not used for more than to make money, that is bring misfortune on as many as possible.
one is part of the richest 20%.
undoubtedly also of the 20% of households which work the most (and create wealth, a part of which is logically redistributed).
fair tax must enable these households to make the most of a part of their efforts.
or better to give up and live on the social benefits, above all if one has social housing.
the utopias of the khmer rouge head cutters have fortunately had their day.
did two airbnb's in norway recently.
no problems at all.
we had things you wouldn't get in a 5 star hotel in one place and we didn't have to check in or deal with any hassle.
just turn up at a place and go in, stay, tidy up and leave.
will be my first port of call every time i'm travelling now.
logo has changed folks...
check your insurance before letting your home.
most need some form of landlord insurance.
make sure that you use a service with a correct logo!
ah 6h too late.
love airbnb.
"it’s very dangerous and high risk" no it's not.
you just go very unlucky.
according to the link provided in the article:
to its credit, airbnb's response to teman was quick, almost absurdly so.
within 24 hours, per an email provided to gawker by teman, airbnb had sent a locksmith to change his locks, made plans to put him up in a hotel for a week, and wired him $23,817 (of which airbnb itself is insured, but nonetheless).
so why is this article quoting teman as complaining that there was no support from airbnb?
love airbnb- for host and travel
hello i am looking for people who have used air bnb before just for some reassurance.
i am looking to put down a deposits and months rent at once but feel cautious of sending £1600 to a site iv never really heard of.
but where are we going?
"to support the troupes" sang the bu$cher over and over again...
harmless weapons then.
i am sure that it will please the families and loved ones of millions of kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends died from something other than saddam hussein's chemical bombardments.
unless the content of this article was radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
the author's style is not really clear: "looking for weapons of mass destruction.
we completely agree.
do you believe that this is the moment to weaken the army to strengthen education
it is never the moment to strengthen education, as we are still at war.
alternative: is it still the moment to strengthen education, as we are still at war?
it would already strengthen education a lot if we made "them" work 35 hours instead of 17.
currently, our teachers earn at present more than engineers.
they cannot make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme.
but that is not seen since the national education does not have the means to provide an office at the school/high school for its teachers, so they work at home.
a sort of forced telework all in all, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
moreover, it is so cushy with 17 hours a week and 4 months of holidays that we cannot manage to fill the maths capes exam, come on, we're waiting for you.
how does that not make you want to put up with poorly educated brats whose parents spit on you treating you like a little shit?
i think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the kurdish population can flourish better.
where one sees that the bush administration did absolutely everything wrong.
my first graduate position was sales in london earning bugger all money and this was a job you needed a degree to acquire.
a year later i saw an advert for being a grunt on london underground which paid £5000 a year more and you didn't even need gcses.
never looked back.
on topic, don't worry about getting a graduate position, get something that either earns you decent money or that you enjoy.
if i'd stayed in graduate positions i'd still be paying off my student loan
i dont really find corporate work fun, so hope in the middle run to either move into government work or into academe.
lol lol lol this article is so late!
exactly, when i graduated in 2011 there was already a three year backlog.
best way to cut the number of unemployed graduates?
scrap the mickey mouse degrees such as art/english/drama/media/philosophy/politics or dole studies as they're known.
i had one of those degrees and ended up as a production manager.
turned out what was important was not the degree but as the article above indicated, a strong employment history, starting at school and continuing through university.
granted the starting salary was lower but you soon move through the ranks as out in the real world it becomes more about being a doer than a knower.
this engineering/arts balls has been running for years.
scientists are not the cure for every problem, it's more important to be able to get up, turn in on time and deal with people in a way that gets things done.
english, philosophy and art are mickey mouse degrees?
that is ridiculous.
presumably you mean degrees such as media studies and whatever philistinism subject you studied.
english, philosophy, politics and art are serious degrees.
we need people who can explain the big issues to high schoolers - who can understand and champion pillars of culture such as literature and art et al.
would a genuine territorial policy not be better to clear paris and dynamize the rest of france?
personally, i cannot see the inhabitants of the very depths of essonne and the val-d'oise doing 80km there and back every day by bicycle to come to work in paris.
the inhabitants from the inner city and the inner ring road already have many much more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> several secured and locked parks, as already exist in cities in the north of europe, in dijon or in lyon, will be installed on the roads.
good idea.
on the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2rms.
incidentally, one hopes that the city of paris will work with professionals from the netherlands and from denmark.
might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
well, we have not found a place for a single bicycle rack.
motivation seems to be greater when it involves finding an office for bertrand delanoë…
well, that is no good at all.
when you argue with pedestrians and other public transport users about the reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the principal reasons which stand out are: 1/ it is so dangerous with all these cars, lorries, scooters which drive extremely fast and do not give a damn about the survival of bicycles 2/ we take a lot of pollution into our body. for me cycling lanes are a last resort, car traffic must be reduced (urban toll like a congestion charge), speed reduced (paris = 30 zone), enforce the highway code by systematically booking offenders (even for bicycles except that it is necessary to adapt the highway code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), extend the buffer zones after the zebra crossings, not before, otherwise cars and scooters do not interfere with each other.
cycling lanes is apartheid, we must co-exist but balance the occupation of urban space.
nothing on bicycles in greater paris?
not a word on bicycle spaces on public transport?
eelv is right.
the goal of 15% of trips by bicycle is ridiculous.
i am starting to believe that anne hidalgo duped the greens.
furthermore, according to what or reports, the eelv assistants seem skeptical.
i prefer to be optimistic.
before the shakedown begins you'd better find out who was really behind the massacre.
hint: it wasn't russia.
not sure if i like the way the world is going.
that sounds terrible.
my children are not a financial asset.
a lawyer has expressed an intention to bring a case before the echr, but i've seen no reports of a case actually having been filed.
also, they would have to file a lawsuit in germany or ukraine first.
i would also expect that such cases would be delayed to wait for the outcome of the air crash investigation and the criminal investigation which would follow it.
yeah but libya didn't blow up pan am 103 either.
malaysia airlines are not at fault, the fault lies with the authority tasked with the safety of the air space, in this case the government of ukraine.
was the accident foreseeable?
other jets were shot down previously, ukraine was launching aerial assaults on rebels in the area and they would of course see any aircraft as a possible, immediate threat.
did the ukraine government take reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or did it choose to gamble the lives of the innocent in order to collect lucrative fly over fees from airlines?
were are all the pro kiev trolls defending their coup government/the ultra nationalists of west ukraine - and arguing that putin basically shot down mh17.
as far as i know there is already a legal action against kiev's government as they are responsible for what goes on in their skies.
the precedent: a judgment by the international court of justice in 1986 held that the supply of weapons to the contra rebel forces in nicaragua by the cia did not mean america was responsible for their actions.
the chances of russia allowing this to go to the icj are zero.
it's funny to think that abbott wants to tell putin that australians were murdered by russian backed rebels.
i hope that he can produce the evidence to back up his claims.
so far the investigators have not said any of such things.
to be called ricardo and be such an eco-philistine is distressing!
to be called polar and lose the north is delightful.
a single philistine question: is the poor person of today poorer than the poor person of yesterday?
i cannot stop myself from remarking that those who criticize piketty's book most virulently have not read it!
it is easy to read, i took a few days.
it shows the statistical evolution of income/production, income/capital, inequalities/concentration, the inequality of income from work, of ownership of capital, merit and heritage in the long term..
it shows that the concentration of capital today is returning to that of the start of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that made the concentration of capital drop, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration picks up after...
bernajuzan: you say no to what.
i am asking you how long it took you to read this huge article knowing that an individual's concentration capacity has limits.
next, the question is not knowing whether it is easy to read.
the question is whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given of it is fair or not.
if it is fair, one can debate it without having read the book, which essentially involves arguing one side in favor of this one.
no, it is not easy to read...
bernajuzan: how long did it take you to read it?
is the central thesis of this huge book summarized by the press false?
i have not read it and i will not read it.
i therefore trust the summary of its central thesis and it is that which seems to be a clear sham.
the notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
has humanity not become globally rich?
and this enrichment added to the population growth is the real political issue today.
malala yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
but remember that she is only 17 years old.
an age where most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
i hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a lucky life.
the prize isn't its the political capital from western governments wanting to prove the old adage of deviant darkies being evil evil evil.
i wish malala all the best in life but she has to realise that she is being used and nothing will be done to educate girls in pakistan or anywhere else - even in working class areas in britain!
did anyone think her speech was a little strange.
she lauded her father for giving her freedom yet mentioned that were she not where she is now she would have been married off at 14.
isn't malala herself one of those "deviant darkies"?
you should not be given 'air time' on this site.
you are, yourself, a horrible deviant.
how absolutely disgusting.
no her father wasn't going to marry her off at 14.
she was 15 when she was shot.
her father runs a school where girls are educated and is in favor of equal rights for women.
he is and was in favor of her both getting a university education and having the right to decide her own marriage plans.
however he is an unusual pakistani man in that he believes women are equal to men.
she was saying the average pakistani girl is often looking at marriage by the time she is 14 with no choice in the matter.
sorry she didn't phrase it artfully enough for you.
it may seem to be a contradiction, but, maybe she means that without her father giving her freedom she would have been married at 14
rather disappointed by this opening to season 4 and particularly by jessica lange who visibly found it difficult to find her double character, marlene dietrich.
i have just watched the last two seasons, which are quite different, but i must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
a fascinating first episode.
the production is close to perfection and the show with jessica lange singing the anachronistic life on mars by bowie is quite simply amazing.
i haven't watched this new series yet (which will be the last for me, without lange meh).
in the case of american horror story i preferred to watch it all in one go to watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
but one thing is sure, apart from extraordinary jessica lange, it is above all the risks in the staging and editing which stagger me.
in ahs we have an avalanche of original shots which ridicule the aseptization of today's productions quite well.
i don't quite understand why you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
jessica lange is certainly one of the mainstays in this series, but, as you said so well, there are many other things.
no, it is simply that, for me, jessica lange (and above all her voice and the way in which she uses it) is truly one of the pillars of the series apart from some technical qualities.
and well i watch it a lot for her.
then i find that the series is flawed by its writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
season 3 was slightly below par, in the 2nd it was too fragmented despite some excellent episodes.
i do not see them doing 10 seasons of american horror story or it is going to finish like 24 otherwise.
but anyway everyone does what they want to, eh!
it is not because i say "i will not watch anymore afterwards" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
i simply share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
the loss of jessica lange, i think that it will be fatal for it.
but, after all, this is just my opinion.
less talk of tax rises, please - just get on with slashing state spending.
no, let's increase spending please.
the slashers have failed.
picking noisy fights over relatively modest chunks of expenditure, such as foreign aid
the problem is that it is less than the margin of error for government expenditure in the uk.
the reality is that we are all talking about a differnece in emphasis rather than the change in direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all sides pretend that the difference is emphasis is something much more significant and substantial - and the voters see through that as being disingenuous.
less than 1pc of managed expenditure.
the "debt" are assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
the "debt" is nothing to panic about.
i would be relaxed about the government appropriating one third of my income (before we get on to taxes on spending) if i felt it would use it wisely.
but i don't and many taxpayers feel the same.
nigel farage is alleged to be less than honest about how taxes can be reduced but then again if you add up our eu net contribution, overseas aid, hs2, subsidies to near-useless wind farms and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should you come to a figure that makes labour's / lib-dem's mansion tax seem very small beer.
your first £10,000 is tax free.
this means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone on £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc, and someone on £200,000 pays around £70,000 (just over a third).
national insurance?
plus national insurance, plus council tax, plus parking charges and road tax, and that's before vat.
almost exactly 30% of my money is taken at source before council tax and road tax.
i'm decently paid, but not wildly so.
not that this is wrong, of course, i'm happy to pay my taxes.
but let's not pretend that there's a magic money tree, or that what happens to billions of pounds of taxes doesn't matter.
how can an unemployed person who is looking for work door to door prove it?
even though 20% of unemployed people were not looking, that means that 80% are looking and don't find anything.
as an unemployed person myself, would it be better for me if the others look or not?
if a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 cvs, that increases my chances in proportion.
in fact, i haven't had any news from the employment center for months; that means that the agents are busier with monitoring operations than with bringing back job advertisements?
i don't see the interest.
because it is not up to the state to provide the jobs.
if the employment center does not provide enough posts, then one must do without the employment center.
how is this a sensitive subject?
we all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that unemployed people fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
just like a conductor asks for transport tickets from users of transport, or a head of department the employees about their work, etc.
no one calls it a scandal in this case, right?
it is indeed good to recall that unemployed people have rights: the only two times that i have dealt with the employment center, my rights to the are were badly established, and on one of the files, cut drastically by 40%, it was necessary to fight a tough battle.
that takes time!
i am not an expert on law.
recording information and monitoring take precedence now, while statutorily the employment center is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
i would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
politicians and french non-employees grant themselves rights which they do not in fact have!
this is not normal.
i would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the improved status of employed work.
awaiting for disastrous tweets in arabic...
in fact it is important to have a direct military response in iraq / syria that will stop isis so that this virus does not reach that war zone.
this situation would then mirror the situation of the spread of the black death in 1348/9 connected to war and the displacement of people then.
the saudis have had the good sense to ban muslim pilgrims from the 3 affected nations from making the haj to mecca this year.
el pais reports 7400 were turned down for visas becuase of nation of origin or previous travel.
there was actually a case of a pilgrim from bosnia contracting smallpox in mecca during a haj in th 80s, probably from a pilgrim from somalia were it was still holding out.
now let's see some good sense in the rest of the world.
is it callous to propose that we stop flying people with ebola into europe?
i thought it pure common sense but apparently those 'in the know' decided a gamble with the lives of 10,000's is okay....
those west african countries where ebola is out of control should be kep under strict quarantine.
nobody leaves.
only healthcare workers allowed in.
a wait of 21 days after treating a patient before they can themselves leave.
if they contract ebola while stationed there, they remain until they recover.
these are not draconian measures.
just during the past week people have been coming down with the illness who have had contacts with people in west africa despite taking 'all necessary precautions'.
the spread of this disease yay be stopped.
it is being spread mainly via airlines.
stop them from operating in those countries.
also, customs agents at airports should be trained to be on the lookout for those with ebola- like symptoms so those who do can be put in immediate quarantine.
if he manages to pass the message on of the individual first and of the group (including religious ones) second and he will have deserved the nobel peace prize.
i doubt that he is capable of setting as dogma the image of god characterized by all the cortices of the planet in operation.
he is still far away from this design.
it has only been 20 years that information has appeared as the bonus given to humanity, while religion, from the cerebellum, has directed our actions since the time of lucy perhaps.
what is the point of becoming an umpteenth protestant church?
for those who have not noticed, catholicism is largely a minority in france today, no one is forced to stick to it.
those who criticize would not in any event set foot in the church, one only has to see the low number of protestants in france.
what is the next stage, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety-provoking"?
@louise: sorry, the church does not have a vision limited to france.
and in the world, maybe that would make it possible to reach more people...
@martine e, to be honest (as usual) the respect for others such as you envisage existed before christ.
hillel already said one century before him: "do not do to your neighbor that which you do not want him to do to you, this is the whole of the torah and the rest is commentary: go forth and study!".
christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but it introduces agape.
your "advance justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
is it a return to communism? :-)
next stage: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
jesus will remain this hero who turned moral laws upside down by redefining respect for others.
christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
not very catholic?
i think that i recall that the low number of protestants in france is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
i am so torn between getting this, the new alien game or wasteland 2.
and the new elite game is coming soon.
you just couldn't make it up.
i'd personally go with som.
i'm liking wasteland 2 (backed the kickstarter for it) but i don't think it's worth £30.
if you're after the pc version, green man gaming currently selling som for £30 and also have a 20% off voucher.
green man gaming currently selling som for £30 and also have a 20% off voucher.
i'll check it out.
obviously not from work.
the killjoys in it block all the fun websites.
hi, is it 30 and then another 20% off, or 30 off including the 20% offer?
beware though that the pc version is dx11 only.
caught me out - i've bought it but can't play it.
i also bought it via steam - so no refunds, which sucks.
time for a new vid card then *sulks*
it's a brazilian site but you get a steam id to use, i think.
caveat emptor and all that - i've not used it myself.
amazon £30 for pc £35 xbox 360 & ps3 £44 for xbone & ps4
thanks, i'd be afraid they might remove it from your library one day if they decided to crack down on people from outside the intended region buying it from there.
jump on the beta train for elite: dangerous.
so, france in 1940 was a "putrid breeding ground"?
say, this nobel prize looks to me to be a poisoned chalice.
one must love the france of the 40s, the one with the "strange defeat"?
when one sees who wins the nobel in literature, one asks oneself if proust or dostoïevsky would have it today.
the nobel is not even an event, we do not even want to read the winning authors.
are brazilians, chinese or australians going to read modiano, which is already difficult to read in french and which describes a universe so limited and egocentric?
i hope that the other nobels are more credible, but frankly i doubt it.
modiano, levy, musso are only remotely connected to literature.
have you read him at least?
or another nobel prize winner?
this would be better to judge.
as for the chinese, the brazilians and others, do not worry about them.
foreigners are very sensitive to french literature and culture, them.
they will know how to appreciate mr.
modiano's true value, if they do not already know him!
for your part, continue to see lévy and musso.
i agree with you.
marc levy and guillaume musso keep all their chances.
now let's see who won the nobel prize in literature: h.
pinter in 2005, d.
morning chumps.
ever since i drove one in iceland, i keep seeing kia sportages everywhere.
it's like the thing followed me back.
maybe it plans to run me over?
i consume me like the terrifying computer in superman iii?
morning dantra, still raging?
morning dq - not today, i've taken my pills.
it's wednesday!
i've had a few days off.
they have been fun.
last weekend i went to the nottingham beer and cider festival.
it was messy.
i managed to sample 19 different ales, with wobbly weasel being a personal favourite.
i was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, it wasn't just camra nerds (not to be confused with camera nerds of course).
the drive back on sunday was painful.
monday night we went round to my mates grandad's for a game of 9 card brag.
some serious beginners luck saw me walk away with a decent couple of pots.
i hope if i make it to 95 i'm as switched on as he is.
last night i went to a fancy cocktail bar in farringdon.
one of my drinks was served with a rasher of bacon on top.

read a little buddha and you will understand to what extent you are making a mistake, dear christian.
having said that, without wishing to annoy you, i believe that you are moving a little away from the subject.
this famous totality, it prohibits searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
it signals without delay trafficking in arms.
one either has large open eyes like meddeb and taïa or boubaker, or one has large closed eyes.
a choice must be made.
it is not by keeping one's eyes closed that one steps into the light.
excuse me, dear christian, but once again, you make a monumental misinterpretation: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, muslim or not, have formally condemned el and his crimes, the french, muslims or not, have noting to add to these official unanimous condemnations.
he who does not say a word consents.
the problem is that people like you see them first of all as muslims, arabs or africans.
not as french.
unfortunately, dear kentoc'h mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
as i have said thousands of times, some have doubts about the approval by french jews of the israeli massacres in gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they publicly demonstrate in order to prove to the rest of the french society that they are wrong to doubt them.
this principle is, to my mind, the denial of the republic and can only contribute towards crumbling french society.
if there is no doubt, one might as well say it.
he who does not say a word consents, but consents to what?
consents to closeness to el or condemnation of el.
silence is very useful, it is the principal weapon of those who wish to try to please everyone.
your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically indefensible.
alex salmond has predicted scotland could “exact revenge” on the westminster parties at the ballot box because a huge gap has opened up between their proposals for devolution and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those westminster seats...
cameron must be laughing his arse off.
what kind of threat is that?
the tories don't give a shit about scotland as they have no power base there.
they can do whatever they like with total electoral impunity.
i doubt even cameron is stupid enough to believe that labour losing westminster seats to the snp is a good thing for him and the tories in the long run.
who will share a tear for the labour party.
facing a total whip out in scotland from the snp and ukip breaking down their neck up north.
ed miliband sign up to the "vow" believing he was saving his party but didn't understand he was signing off the obituary of his scottish mps.
no wonder some labour mps are asking questions of the leader.
if the snp win 20-25 seats in a hung parliament situation, even if the seats don't come from the tories, then they are in a very powerful bargaining position in terms of any coalition and a threat to both the tories and labour in terms of making them do what they'd say about devo max.
think that's more the point.
not if labour or the tories ever want to get elected in england again.
sucking up to 8% at the expense of the 85% isn't great electoral strategy.
plus once the scottish mps can't vote on english matters the tories will win every vote.
oh i think he is.
cameron might not have much to lose, but milliband certainly does.
maggie done it with the ulster unionists and it seemed to serve her well.
yet he's still on course to be pm in 2015, and has been since he won the leadership of the labour party.
so, roughly speaking, these firms will be virtually behind each reader to watch over their shoulder and see what they read, how they read, and up until the end.
this is "the lives of others" from east germany or the kgb applied to the world of cash...
still the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
in the long term, that will have at least a sterilizing effect.

as under this system, drm management is not implemented, it remains for me to read pirated files, books from the public domain or bought from some editors who have the intelligence to offer their files without a control device.
given the price that i paid for the kobo, there are no regrets.
i am staggered at the widespread abdication of users faced with the widespread appropriation of their private life.
at your large public bookseller, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, …).
there are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and finishing rates are undoubtedly derisory.

@thomas: in the era of big data, the data does not really need to be personal to be pertinent.

the collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
the collection is not anonymous.
it is the data published by kobo which is, not making it possible to identify the readers or the authors.
but kobo does really have this information.
there have been so many over top, wrong and contradictory statements from the turkish government in the last few days, that looks like that country is run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic toddlers on acid.
it`s worse than that when you factor in erdogan`s religious fundamentalism.
interesting, that some erdogan supporter thinks islamist is such an insult, that he deletes your comment, but not mine. ;-)
good one :-p but turkey is not interested shooting itself in the leg, unless there is something in it for them.
if it shoots isis, isis will shoot back at them, so it is shooting itself in the leg.
a retired diplomat and blogger writes 'the ap reported that iran has warned the us that it would be making a mistake in seeking to topple the syrian president bashar al-assad as that would put at risk israel’s security.
it is unclear from the report whether iran was giving a dire warning of retribution or counseling circumspection.
it’s more likely the latter is the case and at any rate, the stunning thing is that the us-iranian diplomatic engagement today covers syria, israel and regional security.
indian punchline is highly recommended reading for anyone paying attention to detail as opposed the bs pushed in certain streams of the msm - the small piece you've linked is an important one and should be read in the same light as previous warnings/realist observations which came out of iran regarding afghanistan circa late 1979 - 1980's.
who are these 'moderates' earnestly fighting the the terrible secular assad simultaneously the deviants of isis ?
pipeline politics is driving the world over the edge and i would suggest these people referring to non existent ' moderates' start paying more attention to the facts and other options available before packing other peoples kids off to fight ww iii.
"its worse than that when you factor in erdogan's religious fundamentalism" are there any other religious fundamentalist leaders in the middle east?
i can think of one.
there should be a nuremberg trial for turkish genocide of armenians.
there 'should'?
do you realise that not only the perpetrators, nor any of the victims, can possibly still be alive?
bit late for that, old chum...
aren't the perps gonna be a tad long in the tooth now, like maybe 120 years old?
bit late for that, no?
sprecicially as regards the cup triumvirate who planned and led the genocide, talaat and djemaal were killed just after ww1 in revenge assassinations by the armenians, and enver shot in some godforsaken spot of central asia by the bolsheviks around the same time when he went there on some quixotic mission to found a turkic empire ….
what madness!
an impressive mastery of the slippery slope sophism, but apart from that, one searches in vain for the contact with what is real.
only clichés without an argument.
the fetus will always hear a heart beating, even in the stomach of a surrogate mother.
lesbian couples perhaps simply desire a child and not a wish to be accepted.
sterile hetero couples as well.
as for the children!
what a disgrace to refer to them as future psychologically unbalanced people.
one day, they will be of an age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for the retirement of this woman (?)
gpa is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that the world is experiencing.

the important point in the subject is that this practice is organized so that "commercialization" of the body is limited.
but aesthetic surgery, cosmetics, are they not also commercialization of the body? !
anakronik fahreinheit ...
it is certainly more elegant to get a maid pregnant in a country far away via the internet and paypal than to take responsibility or to prevent the scandal in another century near your home without shouting it from the rooftops at that time! ...
these practices were not, moreover, done in the name of the church! ...
there are not only christians and believers who reject these practices.
the fact remains that the exploitation of the body is a real problem.
oh shut up, the man has a passion for something.

i don't know why there are so many sniffy comments down here about what paul mason is saying, perhaps they are from folk who were never cool even for a couple of years!
i think there's some football stories for you to comment on in the sports section.
top article, true.
since the tony parson's film, there has been a dearth of coverage that really does reflect the actuality of northern culture.
it is hardly a surprise that paul mason has got the social and political context right, he understands things.
northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampired by capitalism, and is now largely a surface phenomena.
that said you can dip you toe in it if you are in the london area in november - 99psoul will once more be spinning soul vinyl with lots of northern on saturday 15 november at farringdon's betsey trotwood.
i thought 'same old story' as well but this is a well written, reflective little piece.
you really need to be more constructive in your criticism.
top article.

the palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
unfortunately, netanyahou never misses a chance to miss a chance to negotiate peace.
@jonathan: netanyahou is not looking for peace, since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (besides, this was also the case with rabin).
it is clear that rabin, netanyahou and their electors all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
he took off his clothes, put them down on the rock and entered the water.
an israeli had stolen them from him.
the israeli representative got up in anger and shouted: "what are you talking about?
the israelis weren't even there at the time!"
the palestinian representative (un) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
israel and the majority of its population have no faith in the palestinian authority's bipolar government and it will not drop its guard...
that this displeases the anti-israelis is obvious, this is not the goal sought...
anti-zionist: but i answered you, i translate: the global geopolitical relationship...
and it is still like this since politics have been globalized...
avoidance, avoidance...
in the israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
for the creation of israel you have not answered.
which power relationship allowed the creation of israel?

do you doubt that?!!! ...
it's about a lot more than russell brand as well, yet the guardian's writers seem to struggle to get beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
a lot of what he says is ghostwritten sub-chomskyian woo
this shows you don't understand what russell brand is saying, or what noam chomsky is saying.
just a collection of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, implying it's to do with immaturity).
a really mean spirited attack, with just a hint of awareness that russell brand is speaking some truth, maybe a truth that is too much to think about.
hold on to your hat, there's going to be a lot more of this sentiment coming!
i can understand why brand rubs some people up the wrong way - can be pretentious in his delivery and after all the tabloid nonsense he does come across as a johnny-come-lately populist, but this whole not voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
the general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and to put their feet up instead and ignore the whole political process - but if you watch the paxman interview and other articles/videos he's posted, he's saying merely voting once every 5 years for labour or conservative (or the lib dems i guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely pointless, as both parties (to slightly differing extents) are basically ruling for vested interests, corporate multi-nationals and the wealthy, at no point does he just say ignore politics completely as these parties aren't ruling in our name - he makes a big point of saying that instead of merely voting and switching off for 5 years, people should become far more politically active from a grassroots level, agitate, protest, petition, whatever and try to influence politics from this level.
i'm not saying i necessarily agree with his solution (as i think being politically active in terms of making demands can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fickle lot who will change their tune if there is a real prospect of them being voted out of office), but it is annoying seeing all these patronising responses saying the silly jesus man is telling the youth to not bother voting and just hope for the best as it is mis-representing his argument.
his solution is extremely debatable, and it would be nice if people would debate what he actually means rather than just label him irresponsible and sideline the concerns that he and a huge amount of disenfranchised people hold.
yes - thank you.
the voting thing has been entirely misrepresented.
i deeply resent the pointlessness of a cross on a piece of paper every 5 years when my vote doesn't even bloody well count.
i want more referenda on issues, voting by hole in the wall technology, direct democracy and mps locally accountable to the electorate.
also, i take issue with the suggestion that russell brand's words are not his own (ghostwritten).
he's intelligent enough to come up with his own words and ideas, even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment, countercultural thinkers and academics that suzanne would happily lump into one "sub-chomskyian woo" box.
i'm pretty sure he'd get suzanne onside in a conversation.
maybe that's what teh guardian could do, get suzanne to do a polly toynbee and to interview russell on a veranda complete with nodding responses edited in!
like max keiser, who started out baiting russel but ended up a fan, inviting him on his show, it's all too easy to attack him without really getting where he's coming from.
he taps into a political narrative that exists through the generations, but which has been marginalised by mainstream media - including the guardian - for generations.
this "rebellion" reveals above all to my mind that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the history meetings, where professional historians have become the minority and where exchanges among specialists have become poorer to the benefit of condensed ready-made thinking typical of political sciences for press releases.
for my part, i saw in pierre bourdieu's intellectual attitude, as well as in michel foucault's, a need to target a culprit, a scapegoat.
they both develop very rational lines of argument, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are the keystone of their thoughts.
i believe rather that for foucault the state was essential as the culprit.
this stems from a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magic thinking.
the problem with the relationship with the other is solved by eliminating it.
there is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or libertarian inclination (of the two terms the second marks a reinforcement of the desire to eliminate the state, the first knowing how to find help from the state for its deals) meaning less state / no state at all in foucault.
the old dream of the base which organizes itself beautifully.
his thinking is built on the culpability of the state: without this culpability it does not hold up.
where there is a culprit, there is also elimination, murder, sacrifice.
this is not taking a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
nor support for that matter.
the totalitarian left remembers the good old days, those of god back then, stalin, the little father of the people.
ooh la la, you undoubtedly read a little too fast if you took foucault's texts on the iranian revolution for an apologia for khomeini.
today, even pierre manent would not enjoy attacking michel any more in this way.
gauchet presents a deep reflection about the contemporary individual and the group, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism for support in our liberal advanced societies.
whether one agrees with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
seeing this plot orchestrated by researchers of human sciences from the hard left who cannot bear that we do very well without allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
the narcissism and authoritarianism of these people has no limits.
an important point to add seems to me to be the position of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
the attitudes i've witnessed in russia towards the chinese and other "yellows" are absolutely jaw dropping.
you haven't had the pleasure of hearing our australian friends on that topic, then.
and where in russia was that, that a russian can meet a chinese and have a personal opinion?
i forgot when i saw a chinese last.
in london, and they were friendly to me, when learned i am russian.
in russia here - in 1990-s the last time, in a market.
the views of chinese towards white people is similar!
my family has lived in australia since coming over from hong kong and guangzhou way back in the mid-20th century and i still hear very extreme anti-white opinions from some of them.
my dad is not happy that his eldest grand-daughter is dating a white boy.
also i believe that attitudes in russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in the last few years: they are becoming more prosperous, the prosperity is spreading outside major cities, and with that prosperity people are travelling overseas and seeing how others live.
from what others have told me, most russian prejudice has been against temporary unskilled workers from the caucasus and central asia, working in occupations and living in areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or exposed to high levels of crime and violence.
though i lived on banks of yenisey river, in sibiria.
sadly, i've heard australian opinions on both the chinese and aborigonals.
it is very strange that a foreigner tells me that i can't stand chinese, when i met two in my life (once was abroad), don't have any bad memoirs, people as people, and, actually, the london ones were very friendly that's why i remembered at all that they were chinese.
otherwise you don't remember who you meet, people like people are, how to remember who was who.
you know what's weird?
that you and the other russian on here are talking about the chinese like they're some sort of unique fascination, like they were a zoo exhibition.
and yet you are still dating said white boy.
how many chinese men are with white women, comparatively?
none, because chances are the white parents of such daughters will physically assault them.
no measure for impartiality of justice.
yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in france remains manipulated by groups which are very much left-leaning, such as the magistrates' union...
@marabout: sorry, but the judiciary sectors are frankly right-leaning.
as for the magistrates' union, it only represents 25% of judges.
if a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it demands two obstacles to be moved away
that of the observer's political vision and the magistrate's factual interpretation.
it remains then the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
the measurement of its non-observance in all magistrates' judicial proceedings, including the public prosecutor, forces a distinction to be made between the error and partiality of magistrates.
it would be in vain to claim that acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
pretension and ignorance do not fall under an objective analysis.
and if therefore all this is not analyzed, how can it be claimed that justice is improving in france?
if it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low down.
the preceding preamble makes it possible to include what follows in the third ratio.
that of the corruption* of the magistrates.
a sensitive subject in proportion to the power to cause harm* granted to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
the field considered is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed even by means of fraud in the proceeding* by inheritance genealogists appointed by notaries.
this professions obtains, in a good or bad year, 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover* ensured by the virtual judicial impunity* of the french notaries.
to understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
where that joins the aforementioned statistical* improvement moderated by the preceding comment is that the judicial institution produced, during the many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to have themselves spoliated in this way, a whole range of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws in favor of heirs.
is the presentation of european statistics which ignore this type of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lying?
absolutely awful prices certainly.
more rip-off equipment for disabled people.
you can say that, but my brother has one of the mountain trikes, built to his dimensions and weight and it has really opened up the outdoors in a way that chunky wheels and tires on a normal wheelchair can't touch.
beauty in the eye of the beholder and all that......
tankchair looks like the sort of thing jeremy clarkson would come up with for a top gear challenge.
tank chair looks epic.
the whill looks like it has been designed by someone who has never cleaned dog poo out of wheel tread.
i'm sure my sister would love the mountain trike but just too expensive.
the ultra long-distance wheelchair would be good for a disabled person with a hankering for longboarding.
we've got hills here that would give them a thrill.
prices do seem high but people do send that sort of money on a bicycle, so "y'know".
i can especially see a case for the mountain trike.
not all disabled people are poor though.
many have a reasonable insurance pay-out to utilize.
only if they became disabled.
the fact is that the wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
the whill could hardly be described as minimalist.
it's an example of over-designing.
sadly it’s just a concept design, with no plans for manufacture.
i'm glad that "long distance" wheelchair isn't going into the market, as there appears to be no way to steer the damn thing.
almost 20,000 houses were destroyed by the israeli army in gaza, during the intense bombardments of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
two million human beings have been prisoners of the israeli blockade of gaza since 2007 (israel is the occupying power in the palestinian territory, not egypt).
half are children and young people who are less than 18 years old.
children of eight years old have lived all their life under the israeli blockade!
unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, as this blockade inflicts "collective punishment" on all civilians in gaza.
"the entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little of their cement towards the black market"...
ah this is not wooden language, but the woman has rather a concrete and reinforced one...
the references are there to support an argument or a fact.
anti-zionist...
the good cement goes in the tunnels!
there is a black market, this is certain, and recognized.
two million human beings have been prisoners of the israeli blockade of gaza since 2007.
a unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
usa has a well-kept site: saudi arabia.
morsi did not have the necessary time to govern as dictatorship (supported by you know who) was excluded!
don't forget either that after removing him, morsi had reestablished the blockade!!!
and i am a westerner, so i approve...
jonathan ...
the blockade is israeli-egyptian...
the children of gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the other side of the population which chose their masters!
boats are a lot of work aleks.
i hope you have thought this through.
couchsurfing is way cooler than airbnb.
it is the definitiion of the not-for-profit sharing economy.
many people just after a bunkup with couch surfing.
so getting paid (or hoping to) in another way.
it's still way cheaper than hotels, if you have to sift for gems.
also, landlords and tenants who trust each other often go off airbnb and deal in cash -- undercutting airbnb.
how's that for community.
"which she to lets on"?
nothing happened to the verb, what happened to your grammar?
the verb "to let" is not used in the us.
the author was just using an american expression.
this is an international newspaper now, in case you had not noticed.
better get the correct insurance on the boat, make sure it's 100% safety compliant, and seek permission from the canal and river trust to be a commercial trader (which they are unlikely to allow) i've got a boat, and have looked into letting it (legit) via airbnb, in short, it's a bloody nightmare...
have you considered that boats can be sailed away, stolen and repainted, sunk etc?
canal boats are so unbelievably slow that if someone stole it would still be within walking distance from where you left it.
or commandeered by pirates...
all those somali immigants, coming over here, taking our canal boats ...
where are you going to moor it?
no marine le pen is not right!
populism?
there is no other truth than that which exposes the facts!
poverty is increasing in france.
more than 150,000 young people leave school without qualifications.
the increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
who defends who?
who defends what?
in 2017 the die will be cast!
capitalism is not going to become poorer!
high finance speculates, plays with our companies and therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our commodities, therefore our food, with our care structures, therefore our health, with our debts, therefore our institutions.
they are a threat in our daily lives due to the same and our money which they are in possession of...
all that for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obese money grabbers.
until proven otherwise, fh said: "my enemy does not have a name, my enemy does not have a face, my enemy is finance".
this was in 2012.
in 2014, he appointed as minister for the economy a former employee of the rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
was there no other competent person?
what do you call that: returning his jacket, dropping his trousers?
primary and populist reaction
in fact, we do not know very much about what marine le pen thinks.
where do you get that from?
because the germans refused to pick up any survivors.
i'm not sure if spee 'refused' to pick up survivors as such.
one aspect of the battle was that neither side appeared to sure of the exact strength their enemy.
robert massie in his book castles of steel suggests that spee left the area promptly because he had received a report of a british battleship in the area.
the seas were stormy earlier in the day - not sure whether this was still the case when the battle concluded?
equally, combat ended after dark so this would make any rescue operation more difficult.
contrast this with the subsequent battle of the falklands, where photos of survivors being picked up show millpond-like seas and broad daylight.
moreover, the rescuers knew there were no more german combatants in the area by that stage.
hmm, not how i remembered what i had read of the battle so i did a quick wiki:
there was some confusion amongst the german ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark once they ceased firing, and a hunt began.
leipzig saw something burning, but on approaching found only wreckage.
nürnberg—slower than the other german ships—arrived late at the battle and sighted monmouth, listing and badly damaged but still moving.
after pointedly directing his searchlights at the ship's ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
without firm information, von spee decided that good hope had escaped and called off the search at 22:15.
mindful of the reports that a british battleship was around somewhere, he turned north.
so if that is accurate the germans, fumbling around in the dark before radar, did not know that one ship had sunk, so could not have searched for survivors from her.
they also believed that there was a bigger rn battleship in the area which could have caused them serious damage, so in the confusion they quit while they were ahead.
they were a long way from home and spee was acutely aware that they had a lot of rn ships to get passed on the way.
cradock's sacrifice had already done them great damage by soaking up about half their ammunition, dooming them when they were eventually caught.
several voices are speaking out in the ump to ask for it to be written in the law that a definitively sentenced elected representative is definitively ineligible as a result of this fact.
that's a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives from the left of course.
but noooo, it is a joke.
for this idea i suggest an inclusion on the magistrates' wall of cunts
when will unions be prohibited in already protected sectors?
how long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
maintained by political schemers whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to soften up the same people who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of genuine politicians, who really try to get things moving, not the smooth talkers whose inaction is on the same scale as their inadequacy.
i met with them on the metro around midday with their little signs "money for justice", they came from the provinces and did not make the distinction between bercy and the popb.
she supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power that they have at the service of their party.
she would not defend the same theses if right-wing unions, even from the extreme right, were choosing figures from their side as their target and were waging a legal-media war against them.
your assertions are totally gratuitous.
if the right is currently the main topic in legal developments, this is simply because it has committed acts which pertain to it!
there are no examples of figures from the left who have had so much to do with the law, but all those who were the object of its attention did not receive preferential treatment.
on the other hand, it must also be recalled that the magistrates' union, which is left-wing, is not the only magistrates' union and that it is a minority.
that a minister should support the unions with such commitment shows to what extent they can be useful.
@mcr the union which you cite may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great in the chancery, this is not a secret.
the question now is if the "mission" of some judges is not more to smear rather than investigate.
@ gus - you should be satisfied, the sm is a minority.
what are you complaining about?
@pivoine: you are forgetting that magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones to have the power to indict and to incarcerate everyone.
jade goody?
how about having none of the contestants back at all?
afternoon, katie waissel.
i think even the most fame hungry jerk realises that the x-factor is a one way street to career oblivion, then i would be surprised if anyone take them up on the offer.
many have used it as a launch pad to great success.
one direction are currently selling out stadiums around the world.
others have gone onto sell loads of records, or moved into the westend.
the forerunner of it popstars launched chreyl cole who is actually on the panel.
even abba, olivia newton-john, celine dion, cliff richard all did the eurovision song contest as did many others.
while others like frank sinatra and all the rest did talent competitions in the usa.
in the 70's and 80's new faces and opportunity knocks provided most to british tv's light entertainment stars.
of course some have slipped into obscurity.
but that happens to most stars who go the non-talent show route anyway.
few people who have a hit single go on to have others.
the most singers/bands can hope for in any case is three albums and a greatest hits.
yeah but cole or whatever her name is now has a fanbase limited to the uk.
some of her fame was dined off her marriage to a mouth-breathing footballer.
more people know in america know who jeremy clarkson is.
a one way street to career oblivion
actually, more of a chance of a career than the usual rock route, though in your delusion you may think every rock poser smoking weed in his dad's garage and bashing out 3 chords over some schoolboy poetry is guaranteed to be the next big thing and all that's left is how big an advance does he want.
and worse than ridiculous: this establishes a completely artificial distance between the western audience and the peoples studied – a distance which turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralized ethnologists present these remote people as immensely superstitious and filled with ritual bigotry, while the majority of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical daily considerations.
unless you are unwisely interpreting in the opposite direction.
very well, but rather than saying that the drum is lacking sacredness, is it not better to admit that our mariannes and our molières do not have a little sacredness either?
our bias is like reminded of seeing the sacred as a sort of well-defined object and contained in the religious sphere.
very interesting article in any case.
it is ephemeral deco to fill the void.
nothing more.
superb article, thank you.
the recent burial in the pantheon of illustrious figures of the republic is an illustration that the sacred sentiment still lives on.
who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists!
any other discipline would cast aside interpretations that are not at all scientific and last the lifetime of a mandarin, rarely less.
when will there be a comparative criticism of the disciplines so that we can laugh a little?
because what holds for archeology also holds for the interpretations that other disciplines give.
that would bring a beneficial dose of modesty.
your contempt for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!
it is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to rebuild history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is exciting.
this method is not very old and before archaeologists trusted their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
nowadays we have technical and scientific means that are so effective that interpreting excavations is better but can still be called into question by other discoveries!
we are right in the middle of (and an old) controversy on shamanism moved forward by the prehistorian jean clottes (see his book "the shamans of prehistory", particularly the re-edition increased with scientific controversy, published by la maison des roches editions).
thank you for this highly instructive article.
straight guys are anal?
for you mike i could be.
so it´s over between us ?
i don't really see why can't we go on as three?
this purports to be a mature newspaper, for grown ups.
do you really feel the need to descend to the level of the gutter?
no, but we're not averse to watching a play about it.
we'd not watch a musical about it, though — that really would be too gay!
might have known we'd get this sort of comment from you.
it seems mary whitehouse has arisen from her grave
might i suggest as your months trial is nearly up you move on to the catholic times.
i am sure you will be more at home.
he prefers mikedow.
might i suggest that we all find a newspaper that pays its brave, real journalists to report on the midle east, ebola etc, at genuine personal risk.
rather than this sniggering, puerile bottom humour.
not clever.
run along then.
if you're so offended by 'peurile bottom humour' then you don't have to participate, do you?
you do also know that this paper is today covering the middle east and ebola and that it's perfectly possible to do both and publish a piece about anal sex?
is it the topic that offends you, or that people have a laugh with it?
nevertheless, the amateur video of the crash is found on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net...??
if the fom chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests, on no account the driver's.
if the fom had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at the moment when another vehicle (breakdown lorry, for example) entered the circuit.
but it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon, which was known was coming, but for which the fom did not deem it appropriate to bring forward the starting time (television rights, adverts, money...).
but apart from that they protect the drivers well.
well read, i also share this opinion.
but also that if the very british fom makes the sc enter, it is going to enable nico rosberg at the restart to have a chance of beating the englishman, who was leading then...
your really let go on this blog my dear dayrton.
but it does not matter, i have a little bit of time to flush out all your stupidities.
no, just no.
there were loads of conspiracies in f1, but never one which puts stewards in danger of death for a remote story of the possibility of the victory of a driver to the detriment of another.
it is not the fom that takes out the safety car it is the fia.
significant difference.
in view of amateur images, the lack of images enables the fia above all to avoid annoying questions such as: how is it possible that the steward is waving a green flag mid-operation and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
no, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the fia blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can continue normally and that it is no longer under the control of the yellow flag.
certain comments show a dark ignorance of f1.
yes dear etienne, the race is no longer under the control of the yellow flag after the place of the accident, hence the green flag is flown.
this is the usual procedure.
the stewards' post just after the accident (depending on the case, this can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) is waving the green to tell the drivers to resume a normal speed.
sensationalism sells advertising.
i used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's 'patriotic' propaganda offensive but i'm afraid that, in the end, it's just the money.
and sex, lets not forget sex, fear of not getting sex, adverts and the media are good at selling us things that may lead us to better sex.
the news does the very same thing.
hyping things up that the public really don't need to fret about and that's all about keeping people scared so they remain controllable.
"when the tabloids cough up an ebola story, we all catch the fear" should be “cook up”, not “cough up”.
given the health connotations of the word 'cough', 'cough up' is a far more effective turn of phrase than 'cook up' in this context...
i wonder if all the people yelling that ebola may become airborne realise they now believe in evolution?
you are giving them too much credit.
they probably believe that it is the end of the world and ebola is just one of the signs of the impending apocalypse.
ebola is the anti-christ!
you're confusing ebola with murdoch....
great article, thanks!
a succinct piece that successfully and soundly ridicules this abhorrent pseudo journalism.
that gave me a good laugh.
it depresses me that the media report most things in this reverse positive way.
it is all a part of keeping fear and anxiety levels high enough (but below hysteria) so that the govt can tip you over the edge when they need it.
i think it makes perfect sense that if we are to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence in the absence of any acts of terrorism, why not have an ebola crisis in the absence of any cases?
this government seems to want to save us from crises of their own invention.
is there not something intrinsically wrong with a fear-based approach to government?
congratulations for this post, and for still being in this world nearly 35 years later.
in addition, at the start it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
i am blown away, living with the certainty of going through it for years...
a perfectly useless testimony.
like whenever science is talked about.
not only do testimonies serve no good: taken on their own, they cannot be used as scientific material.
but they have a damaging influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
this is maybe why one refrains from posing questions to psychiatric patients when one has reliable observations from close relatives.
my psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that i was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
this is therefore an objective symptom.
when i say that it is nonsense, it is a subjective testimony without importance.
ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, which proves the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) serves no purpose in a scientific procedure?
on what do you base your research, then?
on fantasies?
do you place fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies) on the same level?
"resilience": the phony word adulated by grandmothers, fans of j-l delarue, who think they are great psychologists after having read d'ansembourg.
@jim: there are many meaningless buzzwords at the psychs.
cyrulnik did the "resilience" trick on us.
as he is a great scientist, cyrulnik, i hope that he will have knocked together a reliable measuring scale to quantify it, this famous resilience.
i wonder if thunderbirds could save us all from farage and co.??
team america anyone?
seriously, thunderbirds is *not* a good thing to bring back...
why on earth not?
it was a wonderful series and it seems to being brought back by people who recognise that!
leave the saving to the almighty who deals with miracles.
how are they going to make it successful with children though?
i can only see them introduce toilet humour and the like which will wreck it.
it was already a children's show.
that was popular with children.
because it's a children's show?
ukip are mysteron agents.
you can keep team america.
still available in supermarionation?
it won't be the same without the visible strings and the nodding-dog heads. :-)
looking forward to this (even as a grown up), but i hope this also inspires one of the channels to re-run the originals.
it's virtually never been off the air here in australia - for at least the last 40 years, we've had hour-long episodes on saturdays & sundays at 0600.
since the advent of digital free-to-air tv a few years ago, it has been moved to one of the secondary commercial channels & still screens at those times.
the bonus is that half-hour episodes are now on at 0530, monday to friday!
yes, i am probably a "sad" 60 year old bloke, but i don't watch it every day!
there is no "temple mount" in or under the esplanade of mosques!!!
radical zionists invented it to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize jerusalem.
moreover, all the israeli excavations underneath and around the esplanade of mosques for several decades have not been able to find anything.
the temple mount, if it exists, it is elsewhere.
perhaps in argentina?
this mount is not looked for due to the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
its summit, or the dome of the rock, juts out in the middle of the omar mosque.
for muslims, mohammed went up to heaven from this rock.
for jews, it is the mount moriah where abraham almost sacrificed his son isaac.
from the moment when it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear k1k1.
israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember that regularly, and they unfortunately took over in the government (naftali bennet, avigdor liebermann, and even netanyahou, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scrapped it continually!).
it is also to show to what extent the annexation of jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
will god be able to recognize his own?
the shortest jewish joke: "praise be to god!"
to praise tourism in israel to us, we are often shown half-undressed young nymphs, languid on the beach.
the reality is, as usually, quite different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen on the photo which illustrates the article.
it is a bit scary all the same.
and this photo is a magnificent propaganda campaign!
shame that the reuters photographer did not take a photo of the hundreds of palestinians authorized to go back to the temple mount and who prefer to stone faithful jews down below, praying at the wailing wall.
@mat, if this photo disturbs you, it has every right to do so, it is neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
this is not sustainable and will end in tears.
the only way to end it is revolution.
since the economy apparently went to shit big business has hugely taken advantage of their employees.
they have managed to convince their workers that they are lucky to have a job and that they can't afford to be given pay rises, whilst at the same time and in plain sight, they have awarded the elite few at the top bigger and bigger rewards.
you are right it is not sustainable, but it will only end in this country when the working classes actually speak with one voice.
rather than bitch and moan about somebody else's industrial action, support it, show a bit of solidarity and recognise that their action is not only dealing with their issues, but is also showing your employer there are consequences for taking the piss.
not if we get rid of democracy, then it is sustainable.
i totally agree.
the only point you missed was how uk and us business sold our manufacturing and now our service jobs off to countries with the worst, most polluting places with cheapest most exploited workers.
china and india come to mind.
there is no way this is going to end well.
it's because we don't have democracy that it has been sustained.
did you vote for ttip?
the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip) is intended to increase the profits of the corporations that these people own by overriding national governments through secret courts.
that sounds unbelievable but it is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement (isds) part of the deal is intended for.
the the green party is opposed to it and trying to alert people to the incredible devastation it will wreak on our lives.
it is only now starting to appear in the media: independent guardian world development movement please look at these links to understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
did churchill say, blood, sweat and tears?
but these are indeed things which trickle down very well, whereas digital money does not even form drops, let alone drop off trees.
the next weak spot is likely to be the car market.
this man is right, in the 18th there were unions in all the regiments
in the very catholic french army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
leave it (well, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe that it is the safe of france's eternal values, and it will fight and shut up.
and then with the decline of the country, globalization, europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, to have this small relic, it's comforting.
even if for it, it is more and more uncomfortable...
you are still missing the union of married men, single men, married women, single women, lost dogs and i don't know what else
if you do not write french correctly, i'll form a union.
you have been warned, it will be your fault.
for the defence of interest groups, we already have to put up with protected professions equipped with unions quite enough, which created a breach of equality with other citizens.
we are requested not to laugh about a civil servant's fear of risk.
one can very easily imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or without the right to strike like in germany, in exchange for the protection which they enjoy.
otherwise catastrophe is ensured.
and with the charrettes which are prepared, the government congratulates itself.
what security are you talking about?
ignorance indeed...
ignorance for ignorance. sybille i was referring to soldiers and other civil servants, as this is the subject commented on here...
if we remove "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
it will become: "8.
any worker contributing to the collective determination of working conditions and the management of companies".
this is absolutely essential with the irruption of informative power.
and yet you open, presumably read and then post on an article specifically titled 'the great british bake off review'. ?????
look, it was just lying there, empty.
i thought it could do with a conversation starter.
anyway, it was joffrey's wedding i watched - there was some top, top, top, baking action on that episode
joffrey's wedding episode features one of the finest show-stoppers (albeit misdirection - it was the wine) in tv history.
also, mmm pie.
game of thrones!
i love gbbo!
second final in a row where strangely it almost seems like the least worst baker on the day wins - no - one seemed to go "bang - here's my big bastard of a cake now bang it in your mouth and bow to the best" !
perhaps the added pressure of friends and family outside finally gets to them?
in previous weeks all those outsiders have been kept away.
plus there's the feeling of 'stay safe, there's always next week' which disappears on the final week.
i love baking but can't imagine putting myself through this.
i remain grateful to this who do and who give us some lovely entertainment and inspire us to try something different next time.
roll on gbbo15!
id agree, last years final challenge, the wedding cake, was ludicrous.
professionals usually take days to make them and they were expected to knock one together in 3-4 hours.
the three showstoppers were all so neck and neck i couldn't imagine how they'd pick a winner.
luis' bottom layer being a bit dry was the only real fault they found (though i agreed with hollywood that the lime green icing on richard's windmill was a bit off putting, though richard had already blown it by that point).
i must admit, several of the challenges in this series have felt a bit artificial because of the time restrictions.
there is also cancer which lies in wait, with the gusts of solar wind.
we are certainly succeeding at everything at the moment.
a bad moment for humanity to go through is expected.
you are mixing solar wind and ultraviolet rays up.
uv rays are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and uv rays.
so, even if the magnetic field gets weaker, there would not be enough solar wind to "get rid of" the stratospheric ozone.
there would be even more, and therefore less uv and "cancers".
fortunately the ozone layer does not block uv rays.
they have loads of useful functions that you cannot even imagine.
if we limit ourselves to man, they are concerned with allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin d), heating us (apart from infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morale.
the ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic uvc and lets uva and the majority of uvb through.
do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a backward person when you post a comment?
above all for a minor clarification which was implied in the comment, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
without saying that i know melanomas well, uv rays only accelerate their development.
they do not cause them.
as proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanomas.
that is to say, when a doctor tells you that it is necessary to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen as uv rays are necessary for every human.
excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
but for other reasons.
uv rays directly cause melanomas.
does it bend?
more importantly, will it blend?
or blend...
i think the majority of the attention paying population have established, that anything will bend if enough force is applied to it and the iphone 6 is perfectly acceptable in its strength, for the use to which it was intended.
i believe the military may require something more hard wearing and as such haven't adopted the iphone6 yet as its choice in frontline communications.
for the rest of us.
it's a good choice.
the majority of the attention paying population have established, that anything will bend if enough force is applied to it
except a nokia 3310.
more to the point, is it already bent?
this joke is made on every thread.
i've decided to keep count.
this is the fourth bend joke i've read in comments today.
it's quite difficult to see how a prototype could get anywhere near the distribution operation.
by the time the special software is being installed, you would think the phone would be clear of the main production line, and it's difficult to imagine how it would get back into it.
so, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
more likely it is a production unit that hasn't had the ios software installed correctly and is stuck with the factory test code installed.
i have no idea how they make these things.
would they have test software on every single one, though?
the photographs on ebay clearly show the absence of the fcc/ce logo's and a red prototype connector.
ah the quintessential article for bohos.
we want cheap products and we are surprised that the factory-produced ones are produced in factories. we put super u forward, but all brands and even small-scale trade are concerned. how to eat well, bio with €1,650 (average salary in france)?
but to reply to your post, it is possible to eat well with a small salary.
afterwards, everyone is free to set their priorities where they like.
for me food is one of them.
ok then no hard feelings, i send you a kiss
we call bohos, or rather eco-bohos, people who see the world through an ideological "software program", which leads them to disconnect themselves from realities.
it is the full unbundling of thought-reason.
they are experts in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided having a shower.
they are also experts in hypocrisy, agreeing with the caviar left, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning co2 emissions while spending their holidays in the maldives.
the vast majority of our fellow citizens do not put up with this mixture of oafish ideology and hypocrisy, therefore do not be surprised if you often find criticisms on them.
wow, thank for this complete and exhaustive theorization and for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
i would really like to be a part of them, but i cannot find my way around them.
the concept is not that complicated.
the eco-bohos are cast in one piece.
did you understand the concept of the caviar left?
well then, you are in a position to understand the eco-boho concept.
it is a perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
the classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists full stop.
the eco-boho is part of it, but only represents the most visible fringe of ecologists, as it is this one which infests the media.
you are havin' a giraffe.
apparently, no one can see the giraffe in the room.
it's so badly drawn, it loosely resembles a nude female.
ssssh - you're not in on it.
you have to be part of the inner circle of the art world to understand the shocking honest beauty behind her work.
you simply are not qualified to make judgement, not having spent countless decades studying and sycophantically flirting with great artists.
the fact that emin can't draw and seems obsessed with the same subject matter is not the point.
the point is, she actually managed to make herself fabulously wealthy and famous on the back of no artistic ability.
that's *art*.
that's fart
the fact that emin can't draw
not really a fact that one.
more of an opinion.
unless you are only capable of appreciating lifelike recreations of smoking dogs playing pool.
there can be a problem with the institution of art appreciation but not in this case.
drawing encompasses more than mere representation.
if that is all you want then a camera will do.
the author even discusses emin's expressionism.
have another look and let the picture speak for itself - not as a comparison to the type of drawing that you perhaps prefer.
if it's so easy, why don't you do it?
there are still things to economize on: horse-riding activities, the number of republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service...
honesty forces them to say that france is reducing its strength, but like all countries did, sometimes even more drastically, starting with great britain.
it is only half encouraging...
the operational without support, that reaches its limits quickly!
a unique approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, particularly in the sahel.
a bad blow for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, even a part of their history.
where is the promised enshrinement?
@edmond: that is what i was saying, look elsewhere or economize, but above all not in my backyard, my backyard is really not possible...
this is exactly what you suggest doing, look elsewhere where chaos is certain.
let all those who mixed more or less with the military thing dare to come and say here, face to face, that there is no money wasted in this area and without bursting out laughing...
if we apply the same potion to the whole civil service and the public finances will be a bit better.
and for josi: really irritating: look at the inflated public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why defence may regard itself as a little full!
well yes, economies that everyone agrees to say that they must be made, that should be seen somewhere, no?
unlucky, those which this attacks, they moan at the murder when it arrives at their house, poor dears.
this should be done, but especially as it does not attack me, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
guignols, you know!
how will closing the val de grace weaken our defence tool in the sahel?
as for the local communities, history repeats itself with each post, maternity, hospital, barracks closure.
but everyone is for economies of course.
it is strange, a ump mayor who wants to offset and is not delighted with the economies made in public spending.
this is literally the most mind-boggling article i have ever read!
that awkward moment when the first three commenters make the same bad joke.
that life sapping moment when you scroll down your facebook feed and learn that 80% of your friends have started their posts with the phrase "that awkward moment".
i gather there's now a film with that title.
it probably relies on hilarious scenes involving people bumping into their ex's on the bus and getting to work only to discover they have tucked their skirt into their pants.
that's not fucking awkward, it's brain-dead.
not really, to me it sounds like the writer is playing the role of the usual british male brought up to downplay emotions and bite the lip.
i'm sure if you're a kate bush fan, her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been an emotional event.
you realise your post is now being fought over, to be optioned?
i don't have the "internet".
so i don't feel that i can comment.
not having a computer.
omg, if i don't see that i am going to die!
i cannot believe just how mind-blowingly awesome this article is!
charlie has truly proved that he is at the very apex of the stellar universe that is satirical journalism!
i swoon at his feet!
now i have to share this to all my followers and friends on facebook and twitter and enlighten them as to the fantastically inestimable and immeasurably utter brilliance that emanates like a divine glow from mr brooker's keyboard.
god it was crap.
especially when they are neither women, nor transvestites.
i am a parasite.
this shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective community initiatives.
until further notice we make ourselves take away the right to save our planet by states who play the hypocrites at each meeting to save the planet.
we decide therefore, citizens, to take control of things.
with the commissioner who they planted in energy, all these fine recommendations vanished...
you translate: wind turbines and solar farms are the roundabouts of tomorrow.
everything funded by the taxpayer.
i beg you to stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
pollution is not limited to co2.
radioactivity is much more harmful with respect to its waste and in the event of an accident.
as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced.
electricity with renewables to combat co2 emissions?
france is not concerned at all.
nuclear electricity means zero co2 emissions during production and epsilon for the other stages.
renewable wind or pv electricity already means more ghgs in the other stages and above all gas, or worse, coal, like in germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
replacing nuclear with renewable wind or pv would run counter to the fight against co2.
christial, i am not insulting you. i have a state doctorate in physical sciences 1981. in addition, i've done research on nuclear physics, i challenge you to prove the opposite of what i said.
for what i did not say, it is you who lends me ideas. i did not say anything about germany, nothing at all in fact. you have not replied to what i was saying and like all right-wingers i never destroy the interlocutor.
i quote furthermore the conclusion of experts appointed by the german government: germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and ineffective means to reduce ghg emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the water vapor greenhouse gas with less of an effect than co2. it is true, reminder: two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear plant leaves as water vapor and a little in the water of rivers.
didn't read after you referred pakistan as "south asian giant "... !!
pakistan won the last football series against hindustan.
yeah why would you, most indian commenters just want to read and comment on something that's against pakistan.
shows your mentality by the way.
would have done the same thing if they called india as south asian giant...
i have no issues with individual pakistani players playing but a pakistani franchise is a strict no-no.
it would just open a pandora's box of corruption and underworld influences
as for the isl, today's opening match was a surprisingly entertaining affair with athletico de kolkata winning 3-0 against mumbai.
pakistan has a very very long way to go.
comparing it to the vasts billions india spends on the ipl cricket and now the football, how are we ever going to compete with our "noisy neighbours"....
the flight on the low-cost launcher is paid in cash.
a shame for such a fine project.
for the incident, the potential design flaw only shows itself with helium that is too cold.
it is perhaps not a flaw in the design, but in the implementation...
contrary to arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that soyouz belongs to the russian state...
and if the rule is the same as here, the state is its own insurer...
they are going to perhaps pay for the satellites in frigates, who knows..
that is all the more regrettable since a lot of the media constantly go back over only the titles of articles - and that many readers only remember the titles.
all in all that creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
totally in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unjustly calls into question the project, while it is only a problem with the launcher.
