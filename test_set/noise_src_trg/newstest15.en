This is perfectly illustrated by the UKIP numbties banning φ ΋ Ϡ people with HIV.
You ׾ֿ֕ ׍ִּ mean Nigel Farage saying the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK as health tourists, and saying yes when the interviewer specifically asked if, with the aforementioned in mind, people with HIV were included in not being welcome.
You raise a straw man and then knock it down with thinly veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need to use the NHS Տ ճ we have to queue up behind bigots with a sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.
I ۪ ٕ think the straw man is yours.
Health tourism as defined 歡敪甆 憓谏襂 袰苮騱 by the right wing loonies is virtually none existent.
I think it's called democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's policies ૩ઓ ટૣ ઔૼ against health tourism so no problem.

Farage's comment came as quite a shock, but only because it is so rarely addressed.
He ऊेऩ ॸयड़ ़ऊ॥ did not express any homophobic beliefs whatsoever.
You will just have to find a way of getting over it.
I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say, but my guess is that you dislike = % r the media reporting things you disagree with.
It is so rarely addressed because unlike Fararge and his Thatcherite loony disciples who think aids and floods are a signal from the divine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding the complexities of humanity as ׌׺ something to celebrate,then no.
In the end the situation is just as bad in Ireland j0- as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.
Hoping for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a real joke.
Ireland, the "EUROPEAN TIGER" they used to speak highly of to us years ճ ago.

It is starting again when you read this article.
They're trying to pretend that ૹ ૼ Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.
With 획 맔 the agreement of Brussels, the lowest taxes on companies in Europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing emigration.
With ឆឳ these ingredients, there is nothing to "crow about" for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s in the twentieth Î©ô èì¶ êæÃ century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal. Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it ever was.
Greece was ahead.
It is clear that their ए ॉ ष development was not a long quiet river, given the recent events.
The lowest taxes in Europe?
That is not correct!
Latvia has a Ҷ 0% tax rate for companies.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay.
If we سۢ ؈ۘ ؃ۆ believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they generally pay less than 5% in France.
Only SMEs pay the full lot.
Now I confirm ्डज ऑज़ऐ that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, exactly like before the 2008 crisis.

Any article about Ryanair attracts dozens of comments from ი people who would never fly Ryanair, to those who like flying Ryanair and think anyone paying anything more than the basic fare has only themselves to blame, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair are not going ठर to be happy about the extra cost involved in this incident.
I wonder how long the delays will be and will compensation to passengers by due and if so, can Ryanair then get out of paying as they can say it was the airport air traffic controllers error.

Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: le Marais is largely pedestrianized, I] and is literally swarming with people.
The people have not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (ordinary, for ΂ ϰ the most part) or for the Journal fair at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly outmoded).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open 😐😇 😥😴 😑🙎 and the area is incredibly lively and animated.
With ׸֭ קו ֽ֨ a lot of foreigners who spend...
Do you think that ้ opening on Sundays is going to create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of 😭😃😿 people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The ौञ only argument that would seem admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign tourists and this is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax-free.
Tourist areas 😡 😯 😵 lose a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons.
The industry remains, where expensive equipment, ゴ ゠ used on Sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is 😪 a right that employees, besides exceptions, enjoy.
That's the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code.
Neither the ministry responsible for the economy, nor, moreover, the one responsible for foreign affairs, have ึ๙ ๸ห the slightest competence to reform the labor code.
So they should shut up.
What うれざ にゐべ use is the law?

But for ךױ֩ ֑׭׀ ׽ֳַ 5 years, and five years only mind, he was perfect.
He stood against his fellow aristos in Government in 1940 who wanted to discuss ' terms' with ๏๪ the nazis and very cleverly saw them off.

iPhone 6 and budget rivals hit Samsung profits

I ჸ ვ Ⴡ think it is vital that we have alternatives.
When Microsoft instituted this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google, Apple and the opensource community.

We also have completely different requirements ֪֒ and these cannot be satisfied by any one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For [E_ '6s myself, I tend to buy Apple, because I like the underlying philosophy and appreciate design.

There is nothing wrong with that.

Could our friends Çð ½¢ ¥¿ from the UMP who, according to one of them, combat ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course the Parisian bohos) tell us which author's/s' ideas on gender they are combating and specify exactly which works that they are intending to combat.
Or ๢ีา ๻๎฀ do they just attack gender as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Valeurs Actuelles?
Are their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like थ॒ ०ॼ you a lot, and you are someone who is intelligent and cultured.
I said 😞😇 that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a parallel which did not occur to me (I do not have her sharpness of mind).
Otherwise, all things considered, as you refer to it, this subject does not ၿ ပ ဳ interest me, and, sincerely, I cannot see where the problem is: I would hope that you and your friends could get me out of my retardation, as I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes, that does it.
Who is scared asks le Monde?
But what do úû§ £ëÀ those who are scared fear?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by referring to Judith from the Bible, the second by describing ҞӤ ҵс ӣҋ Judith Butler as a very symbolic throat slicer.

@ Jean, have you read ჻ჩჺ Ⴍ჊Ⴗ ჼႤჼ that le Monde published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: As it was about a debate of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go ჃႠ ჉჆ to the sources.
Intending to ~ S n combat ideas from the only report that their critics make of it (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory, or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
But anyway, as ヺヌ I was explaining to our friend from the UMP, that is the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure, however, that he has understood the nuance.

As I was viewing ׯ the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw flashes of red colour as the Moon briefly revealed itself when the clouds parted.

I thought the case against Milosevic was decided and finalized about 10 years ago.
I haven't seen the man's name in print in at least that long.
What's going on?
It's an anniversary.
A forgotten one.
His trial was brought to an end "swiftly" and ۈہڒ then swept under the carpet.
Was this the story that was told back 淰襑譐 then?
Communist-turned-nationalist who ignited three ข๕ Balkan wars in the past decade?
Communist ՕցԱ president of a Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please, question the ীঌ৬ ঄ঔস ঎ঝজ facts that are conveniently missed out: 1.
Explain how NATO bombing was legal ن۪٧ under ANY norms of international law.
What country Ⴒ ე did Serbia attack?
When talking about 릹놴 흮쟖 RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia) why do you fail to mention how NATO blew up that same building killing civilians and then deemed it a valid target.
Milosevic was done ႡჍႧ however one flips the coin: If he didn't defend his country against NATO attack he would get crucified as a traitor.
If he did, he would get eaten up by western justice system.
Westerners deemed false flag and detached part of a sovereign state witch later unilaterally գցԾ ՛՘ք ԰Եր proclaimed its independence and was expressly recognized by western states who proceeded to flat out lie about situation on the ground.
Serbian population now is װ ֔ non existent (ethnically cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica ѽѷ ӽҡ ҏЖ who here is mentioned, politically died after his first term after failing to comprehend situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of મો૯ most controversial figures in politics of that time.
In σ Θ the end, Guardian staff should not call Milosevic a tyrant (as much as he was not popular among us).
As far as I know, ざぷ゛ あめて うゃ゗ only in Greece is there an earthquake prediction method that works more or less, by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This type of study is indisputably ؊ؚٗ ڰڸ۠ ٠ڦۃ useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
A 😡 hope therefore, but caution should be exercised. This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years away from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which is "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study led by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine's team from the University of Maryland.
The method to ี๛ฐ จ่ล be followed then.
Just like those which involve animals סונ ֧׬֮ feeling threatened.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for treating us, often, to these experimental feats which are achieved in the world. ûº íË
How ぃびも よくな would animals know (in advance)?
Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the ঔ঻ ৰড ক৔ event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An odorless ॶ gas a priori for man but may be detected by animals.
All these methods ៣ are undetectable by man, but not for the measuring instruments which they have at their disposal.
But we do ² not have reliable results on these clues...
It was observed many a time (and for centuries) that 😔 😮 🙆 certain animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake, particularly hens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report ZE on the arte channel telling of the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to ensure the recognition of the validity of their work which was about animals' sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly about their modification before an earthquake.
Well of course I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses had convinced me!
How far have we got on this research?
Why so much contempt towards ៑៘ this line of research?
We should learn how to listen to nature again...
If one examines things УҲ Щѓ Ӓѵ calmly and rigorously, one publishes it in a serious journal, and no one looks down on it.
As soon as we talk about "signs" given by animals, we come up against the same slant: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the ৥ ৢ প goldfish was strangely going round in circles.
I don't understand why anyone thinks Boris will make a good Tory 땪턓돳 뱯졑랫 Leader.

Listening to the LBC phone-in and you ะอ can't help but thinking this man hasn't got a clue and is always desperate to distract you with a joke.
He never gives a straight answer to ჎ႪჍ anything.
Another ৥ ছ ৴ point he said was that he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked what he agreed on?

Is there any players in the current Serbian 😹😬 🙋😐 set up of Kosovan descent?
I know Lyon's Dusan Bajevic and Milos ヺ Krasic, late of Juventus and now at Fenerbache, are from Mitrovica but don't know if they're still involved in the squad
Bisevac is Lyon's defender not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder Ⴢ჉ჵ ჺႢႺ ღრႦ or forward in the 70s and 80s, and coach of many teams in Greece, but I dunno where from.
Bajevic is T e h from Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and played as a striker for the great Velez side that, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished as runners-up in the Yugoslav league (and also included such luminaries as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's trusty side-kick Boro Primorac).
Why, thanks Mole!
I sure know who Halihodzic and Primorac are.
Just out of interest, what happened to Krasic?
He was tipped to be the next big thing whilst at Juve and that he is currently in Turkey 🙌😫 🙇😧 but the last time he appeared on my radar he was being linked with Blackburn *shudder*
Can't help you there.
I know he lost جڡڝ گةۯ his place when Conte arrived, then he moved to Fener, and as far as I know he isn't regular there.
There might be one more プキジ バゾジ move in him, perhaps Indian Super League?

You should love albania because you are neighbours. ঝঽ৒ ৪৙৏
The thing 😖😼 is, the flag in that dron wasn't the flag of the actua, current Albania.
It was ֘ apparently the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant presence of Albanians.
A bit of 촡 각 옧 excessive nationalism, basically.
Thankfully, there were no significant casualties (that I know of).
actually, it ည ၕ was the Albanian flag shaped like the map of not the so-called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the european great powers decided do give give parts of the country to the neighbour countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers ê ¬ â collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children were inside?
How??
What bothers me a little in 酥圳矗 this "account", is the mere fact of having been able to, even if it was just once, be spontaneously delighted at the horrible death of thousands of people; in my eyes it bears witness to a "border line" personality, all the "accounts" of whom should be taken with the highest circumspection.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", one will not have thought of the ႙ ူ dead nor the reality of the horror inflicted.
One will have only thought, for one instant, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalyptically hurting the big bad Satan in Рѝ Ѐӧ Ӈа his heart itself.
Doing something powerful.
Something grand.
It 😩😤 😇😎 would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims consumed by their feeling of humiliation.
With accounts filmed in Palestine.
Classic ો૦ ઞડ મ઎ Schadenfreude.
We had some doubts.
The West "Christian/white/Gauls" cannot measure the degree 😴 of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general poverty, social and cultural under-development of the Arab-Muslim world today.
I'm Ⴭ჏ ჋ძ talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The former splendor, certainly glorified ٙ is no consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this diabolical hole?
Entirely in agreement, 2 major poisons run through the Arab World I: 瑓 轀 蠋 the bigoted conservatism of the powers in authority and fascistic nihilism.
The ば ぇ thing in common, the suspension of thought and the excommunication (gentle or armed) of their critical expression.
As may have been understood before, do not make the Ϻͽ Muslims retreat.
This is the فڣ؏ only way.

In many countries I suspect that's ჶჁ ჟ჆ ჉Ⴉ true.
But in Britain autumn is the start of six long Ⴧ჉ჷ Ⴔ჈ჴ wet miserable dark months which affect many people's well being and mood.
Every one gets ill, too.
Seasonal Affective Disorder.
I suffer from it myself.
When that ៸ light starts to go its hell for me and those like me.
A dose of Vitamin ֱ֪׺ D should help with some of the mood and well being issues.
Autumn in Britain is beautiful, with Y ? or without the rain.
The countryside especially ฌ ๪ ๑ is breathtaking in autumn.
not as breathtaking as summer greenery when everything á û is alive instead of being on the verge of death.

For the taxation on the increases for children, it is the amount collected by the State Â which essentially originates from deciles 8 to 10.
But 😈😎😃 😏😎😷 😎😷😿 concerning the number of households which have seen their taxes increase following this measures, the fourth and fifth deciles (median incomes) are those concerned above all according to diagram 2.
The ë abolition of the half-share concerning above all widows was not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact was completely under estimated: 230 million euros is a joke which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.

If for once the PS makes a policy that ៛ ឮ is left-leaning instead, we're not going to cry...
It is clear that ဌဠႄ ဦၱႂ ၈႓ၛ those who make up the 20% richest must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Continue like this and ႀၖ ၗဤ you will encourage this 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically ဳု႑ correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trotskyists and the OCIs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you see badly what you are looking at.
The proportion is ি৘ ৌ৅ always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
Fair taxes is রফ when it stops anyone from amassing as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness. ၛ ၿ ၀
And once the usefulness of money has been exceeded, money is not used for more than to make money, that is bring misfortune on as many as possible.
One is part 탈 햔 of the richest 20%.
Undoubtedly also of the 20% of households which ¶þ® work the most (and create wealth, a part of which is logically redistributed).
Fair প ঑ tax must enable these households to make the most of a part of their efforts.
Or better to give up and live on the social benefits, above all if one has social housing.

To its credit, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, ថឯៀ almost absurdly so.
Within 24 hours, per an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had E sent a locksmith to change his locks, made plans to put him up in a hotel for a week, and wired him $23,817 (of which Airbnb itself is insured, but nonetheless).
So why is this article quoting Teman as complaining that there was no ক ঊ ছ support from Airbnb?

Unless the content Ҿ ў ӑ of this article was radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).

We completely agree.
Do you believe that this is the Ղ moment to weaken the army to strengthen education
It is տ never the moment to strengthen education, as we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it STILL the moment to strengthen education, as we are still at war?
It would already strengthen education a lot ค ๚ ์ if we made "them" work 35 hours instead of 17.
Currently, our teachers earn at present more than engineers.
They cannot make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme.
But that is not seen since the National Education ѺҸ does not have the means to provide an office at the school/high school for its teachers, so they work at home.
A sort of QF ;x forced telework all in all, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Moreover, it is so cushy with 17 hours a week and 4 months of ӁӽҴ holidays that we cannot manage to fill the maths CAPES exam, come on, we're waiting for you.

Would a 쐱 genuine territorial policy not be better to clear Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I ઍભઘ ૱ઋશ ઓૠમ cannot see the inhabitants of the very depths of Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km there and back every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants from the inner city and the inner ring ռդ road already have many much more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).

Well, that is no good at all.
When you ՗Է ֌Ղ argue with pedestrians and other public transport users about the reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the principal reasons which stand out are: 1/ it is so dangerous with all these cars, lorries, scooters which drive extremely fast and do not give a damn about the survival of bicycles 2/ we take a lot of pollution into our body. For me cycling lanes are a last resort, car traffic must be reduced (urban toll like a congestion charge), speed reduced (Paris = 30 zone), enforce the highway code by systematically booking offenders (even for bicycles except that it is necessary to adapt the highway code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), extend the buffer zones after the zebra crossings, not before, otherwise cars and scooters do not interfere with each other.
Cycling lanes is apartheid, we must co-exist × Ö but balance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on bicycles in greater Paris?
Not a word ¯½Ú Ã·À on bicycle spaces on public transport?
EELV is ៏ right.
The goal of 15% of trips by bicycle is ridiculous.

Malaysia Airlines are not at fault, the fault lies with the authority tasked with the safety of the air space, ՉՂշ ձփը in this case the government of Ukraine.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other jets were shot down previously, Ukraine was launching aerial assaults on rebels in the area and they would $ , of course see any aircraft as a possible, immediate threat.
Did the Ukraine government ღ take reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or did it choose to gamble the lives of the innocent in order to collect lucrative fly over fees from airlines?

As far as I know there is already a legal action against Kiev's government as ૶િ પ૫ they are responsible for what goes on in their skies.
The precedent: A judgment by the Ո Ք Ջ International Court of Justice in 1986 held that the supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua by the CIA did not mean America was responsible for their actions.

It shows ヰヸ ンョ that the concentration of capital today is returning to that of the start of the 20th Century before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that made the concentration of capital drop, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration picks up after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I am asking you how long it took you to read this huge article knowing that an individual's concentration capacity ׺ has limits.

The question is დმ ჊჆ ႳႣ whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given of it is fair or not.
If it is fair, ႽႱႭ one can debate it without having read the book, which essentially involves arguing one side in favor of this one.

Rather disappointed by this opening ๆ ๅ ๘ to season 4 and particularly by Jessica Lange who visibly found it difficult to find her double character, Marlene Dietrich.
I have just watched ૯ળ the last two seasons, which are quite different, but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A ビブ fascinating first episode.
The 😮 😳 production is close to perfection and the show with Jessica Lange singing the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is quite simply amazing.
I haven't watched ず ゙ this new series yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange meh).
In 폗휃 엕쳸 뙐뭧 the case of American Horror Story I preferred to watch it all in one go to watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But ΅ κ one thing is sure, apart from extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks in the staging and editing which stagger me.
In AHS we have an 😅😽 😷🙇 avalanche of original shots which ridicule the aseptization of today's productions quite well.
I don't quite understand why you throw ၶၳ ဈၢ in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly one of the mainstays in this series, but, দৈ ৪৐ as you said so well, there are many other things.
No, it is simply that, for ۛڈ ّڼ me, Jessica Lange (and above all her voice and the way in which she uses it) is truly ONE of the pillars of the series apart from some technical qualities.
And well I watch it a lot for her.
Then I find that બ૜૧ ૚૎્ the series is flawed by its writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was ֱ slightly below par, in the 2nd it was too fragmented despite some excellent episodes.
I do not see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it is going to finish like 24 otherwise.
But anyway everyone does what they want ๨๰ to, eh!
It is not because I say "I will not watch anymore afterwards" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view, nothing דֳׇ ׺׾׈ more, nothing less.
The loss of くぶみ すぷん きゞぉ Jessica Lange, I think that it will be fatal for it.
But, after ျ all, this is just my opinion.
Less talk of tax rises, please - just get on with slashing state spending.
No, let's increase spending please.
The slashers have failed.
Picking ׵ב֖ פ׏׽ ׂׅ֛ noisy fights over relatively modest chunks of expenditure, such as foreign aid
The ๵ พ problem is that it is less than the margin of error for Government expenditure in the UK.
The reality is that we are all ֎ըշ talking about a differnece in emphasis rather than the change in direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all sides pretend that the difference is emphasis is something much more significant and substantial - and the voters see through that as being disingenuous.
Less than 1pc of managed expenditure.
The "debt" are assets held mainly 😝😘😥 😻😋😋 by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to panic about.
I would be relaxed about the government appropriating one third of my income (before we get on to taxes on spending) if I felt it would use it wisely.
But I don't Σͺ͸ and many taxpayers feel the same.
Nigel Farage is alleged to be less than ઍી૜ ુુધ honest about how taxes can be reduced but then again if you add up our EU net contribution, overseas aid, HS2, subsidies to near-useless wind farms and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should you come to a figure that makes Labour's / Lib-Dem's mansion tax seem very small beer.
Your first £10,000 is tax free.
This कङे means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone on £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc, and someone on £200,000 pays around £70,000 (just over a third).
National insurance?
Plus national insurance, plus council tax, plus parking ိဧၩ charges and road tax, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 😖🙌😼 😣🙎😅 30% of my money is taken at source before council tax and road tax.
I'm decently paid, but not Ѣ Ғ wildly so.
Not [<# _=x that this is wrong, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that there's a magic money tree, or that what happens to billions of 벳 꽖 팋 pounds of taxes doesn't matter.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work র ২ ৪ door to door prove it?
Even though 20% of unemployed people were not looking, that means 😔🙃 😆😸 that 80% are looking and don't find anything.
As an unemployed person myself, would it be better for me if the ׾ others look or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances in proportion.
In fact, I haven't had any news from the employment center for months; that means that the agents are busier with 5k monitoring operations than with bringing back job advertisements?
I don't see the interest.
Because ֡ it is not up to the State to provide the jobs.
If the employment center does not provide enough posts, then one must do without the employment თ ტ center.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all ョップ ベトゾ have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that unemployed people fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
Just そ ゛ like a conductor asks for transport tickets from users of transport, or a head of department the employees about their work, etc.
No one calls it a scandal ণৈ ৵ৣ in this case, right?
It is indeed good to recall that unemployed people have rights: the only two times that I have dealt with the employment center, my rights to the ARE were badly established, and on one of the files, cut drastically by 40%, it ֭֜ טכ ֵף was necessary to fight a tough battle.
That takes time!
I am not an expert on law.
Recording information and monitoring take precedence now, while statutorily the employment center is close to being, ׆ ֒ in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only ัช ๩๪ concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and French non-employees grant themselves rights which they do ם֙ך ֡ץ֘ ֟׊֒ not in fact have!
This is ฉ๡ฎ าฝ๼ not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance єоЍ айм contributes to the improved status of employed work.

These are not draconian measures. y x 8
Just during the past week people have been coming down with the illness who have had contacts with people in ႦცႪ west Africa despite taking 'all necessary precautions'.

What іѮ ЄҚ is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?

@Martine E, to 詉偉 藦導 be honest (as usual) the respect for others such as you envisage existed before Christ.
Hillel already said one century ԰Վձ խվս before him: "do not do to your neighbor that which you do not want him to do to you, this is the whole of the Torah and the rest is commentary: go forth and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond ၻ၅ၙ ၊ႁသ ႖ဝ၏ simple reciprocity but it introduces agape.
Your ၎ႋ ၛအ "advance justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next stage: we remove Նս the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who turned moral laws upside down by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in ϷϗϪ the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not ឡ៯ោ ឮ៸៍ very Catholic?
I think that I recall that the low ័៟ឳ ៝៍៹ number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.

So, France in 1940 was a "putrid breeding ground"?
Say, this Nobel prize looks to me to be a poisoned chalice.
One must love the France of the 40s, the one with the "strange defeat"?
When one ႏ ၪ ၘ sees who wins the Nobel in literature, one asks oneself if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not גפח ׸ץד ֯׶֞ even an event, we do not even want to read the winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which ৡ ৈ হ is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and egocentric?
I hope that the ទឆ other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso are only ც ჩ remotely connected to literature.

This principle នឩ ោៀ ៮រ is, to my mind, the denial of the republic and can only contribute towards crumbling French society.
If there is no doubt, one might as well say it.

Alex Salmond has predicted a{I Scotland could “exact revenge” on the Westminster parties at the ballot box because a huge gap has opened up between their proposals for devolution and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those Westminster ៶នញ seats...
Cameron must be laughing his arse off.
What kind of threat is that?
The Tories don't give a shit about Scotland as they Ѵҭҥ have no power base there.
They can do whatever they like with total electoral impunity.
I doubt even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Ͻ Labour losing Westminster seats to the SNP is a good thing for him and the tories in the long run.
Who will share a tear for the Labour Party.
Facing a total whip out 굣 댤 붆 in Scotland from the SNP and UKIP breaking down their neck up north.
Ed Miliband sign up to the "VOW" believing he was saving his party but didn't understand he was signing off the ׊֨װ ע֨כ ּ֫׭ obituary of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking questions of the Leader.
If the SNP win 20-25 seats in a hung parliament situation, even if the seats don't come from the Tories, then they are in a very powerful bargaining position in Ⴁ ძ რ terms of any coalition and a threat to both the Tories and Labour in terms of making them do what they'd say about devo max.
Think that's more the point.
Not if Labour or the Tories ever want to get elected in England again.
Sucking up 뻘햙 to 8% at the expense of the 85% isn't great electoral strategy.
Plus once the Scottish MPs can't vote on English matters the Tories will win every vote. Ⴡ჈მ ჹႢჵ

A retired diplomat ベホ ラキ ッバ and blogger writes 'The AP reported that Iran has warned the US that it would be making a mistake in seeking to topple the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as that would put at risk Israel’s security.

It’s more ษฏ likely the latter is the case and at any rate, the stunning thing is that the US-Iranian diplomatic engagement today covers Syria, Israel and regional security.

It's about a lot more than Russell Brand as well, yet the Guardian's writers seem to struggle to get ૼ ધ ૃ beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of װ֡ what he says is ghostwritten sub-Chomskyian woo
This shows you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying. ႫႰ
Just a collection of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, implying it's to do with immaturity).
A really mean spirited attack, with just a hint of awareness that りなけ あぁな Russell Brand is speaking some truth, maybe a truth that is too much to think about.
Hold on to your hat, there's going to be Σ ͳ ͼ a lot more of this sentiment coming!
I can understand why Brand rubs some people up the wrong way - can be pretentious in his delivery and ӎ х after all the tabloid nonsense he does come across as a johnny-come-lately populist, but this whole not voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and to put their feet up instead and ignore the whole 鋴 蘓 political process - but if you watch the Paxman interview and other articles/videos he's posted, he's saying merely voting once every 5 years for Labour or Conservative (or the Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely pointless, as both parties (to slightly differing extents) are basically ruling for vested interests, corporate multi-nationals and the wealthy, At no point does he just say ignore politics completely as these parties aren't ruling in our name - he makes a big point of saying that instead of merely voting and switching off for 5 years, people should become far more politically active from a grassroots level, agitate, protest, petition, whatever and try to influence politics from this level.
I'm not saying I necessarily た し agree with his solution (as I think being politically active in terms of making demands can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fickle lot who will change their tune if there is a real prospect of them being voted out of office), but it is annoying seeing all these patronising responses saying the silly Jesus man is telling the youth to not bother voting and just hope for the best as it is mis-representing his argument.
His solution is extremely debatable, and it would be nice if people would debate what ÷Ñí he actually means rather than just label him irresponsible and sideline the concerns that he and a huge amount of disenfranchised people hold.
Yes - thank you.

I deeply resent the pointlessness of a cross on a piece of paper every 5 years when my vote doesn't even bloody well count. 좷뾷 쫜땪 링젡
I want more referenda on issues, voting by hole in the wall technology, direct democracy Ҷ Ӣ and MPs locally accountable to the electorate.
Also, I take issue 벛릢 쟛럙 with the suggestion that Russell Brand's words are not his own (ghostwritten).
He's intelligent enough to come up with his ֈՙ Ւՙ վԴ own words and ideas, even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment, countercultural thinkers and academics that Suzanne would happily lump into one "sub-Chomskyian woo" box.
I'm pretty sure he'd get Suzanne {Ix \@= Y)d onside in a conversation.
Maybe that's what teh পখৰ Guardian could do, get Suzanne to do a Polly Toynbee and to interview Russell on a veranda complete with nodding responses edited in!
Like Max Keiser, who started χͿκ δϵΜ ͿΠί out baiting Russel but ended up a fan, inviting him on his show, it's all too easy to attack him without really getting where he's coming from.
He taps into a political narrative that exists through the generations, 蒡 but which has been marginalised by mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "rebellion" reveals above all to խ ՘ ՞ my mind that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the History Meetings, where professional historians have become the minority and where exchanges among specialists have become poorer to the benefit of condensed ready-made thinking typical of Political Sciences for press releases.
For my part, I saw in チ Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude, as well as in Michel Foucault's, a need to target a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational lines of ឵ ឪ argument, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are the keystone of their thoughts.
I believe rather that for Foucault the State was essential as the culprit.
This stems from a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magic thinking. भ़
The problem with the relationship with the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or libertarian inclination (of the two terms the second marks a reinforcement of the desire to eliminate ش٭٥ the State, the first knowing how to find help from the State for its deals) meaning less State / no State at all in Foucault.
The old dream of ึ า ฽ the base which organizes itself beautifully.
His thinking is built on 🙉😠 😒😘 the culpability of the State: without this culpability it does not hold up.
Where there is a culprit, there is also elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not taking ՝ զ a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the บณ ฌ๤ good old days, those of God back then, Stalin, the little father of the people.
Ooh la la, you undoubtedly read a little too fast ၃ႍ if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apologia for Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not enjoy ๕๣฀ ฼ฃป attacking Michel any more in this way.
Gauchet presents a deep reflection about the contemporary individual ؽ۩إ ٞۏۑ ڎ۱ڜ and the group, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism for support in our liberal advanced societies.
Whether one agrees ๊๞ส ฯ๫ฃ with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this plot orchestrated by ぢ researchers of human sciences from the hard left who cannot bear that we do very well without allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these ា people has no limits.
An important point to শ ঋ ৎ add seems to me to be the position of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The attitudes I've witnessed in Russia towards the Chinese and other "yellows" are absolutely ؊ڷ jaw dropping.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on that 뮩뜾츐 촌칒횔 굌뭚썅 topic, then.
And where Z> )Y in Russia was that, that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I ひ ぞ forgot when I saw a Chinese last.
In London, くね しう ねゞ and they were friendly to me, when learned I am Russian.
In Russia here 鏶鍭 噮瓄 翴魴 - in 1990-s the last time, in a market.
The views of Chinese towards white people ォビ is similar!
My family has lived in Australia since coming over from Hong Kong and Guangzhou way back in the mid-20th century and I still hear very extreme anti-white opinions from some of them.
My dad is not १शॶ चखॏ ौणब happy that his eldest grand-daughter is dating a white boy.
Also I believe that attitudes in Russia ϟ · have changed since the 1990s and especially in the last few years: they are becoming more prosperous, the prosperity is spreading outside major cities, and with that prosperity people are travelling overseas and seeing how others live.
From what others have told 붺뷓등 뗜찎뚳 촡짎갅 me, most Russian prejudice has been against temporary unskilled workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, working in occupations and living in areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or exposed to high levels of crime and violence.
Though I lived on banks of Yenisey river, in Sibiria.
Sadly, I've ψ Δ Ώ heard Australian opinions on both the Chinese and Aborigonals.
It is very strange that a foreigner ঩৏ঢ কহণ tells me that I can't stand Chinese, when I met two in my life (once was abroad), don't have any bad memoirs, people as people, and, actually, the London ones were very friendly that's why I remembered at all that they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, 閌滎伅 橗钁眡 people like people are, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other russian on here are talking about the chinese like they're some sort of unique fascination, like they ëØø were a zoo exhibition.
And yet you are still dating ॱ ॠ औ said white boy.
How many chinese men 闹 葱 are with white women, comparatively?
None, because chances are the white parents of such ヱ daughters will PHYSICALLY assault them.
No measure for ๛ธโ ๥๷แ impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of ួ៓ឭ all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups which are very much left-leaning, such as the magistrates' union...
@Marabout: sorry, Ή but the judiciary sectors are frankly right-leaning.
As for the magistrates' union, it only represents 25% of judges.
If ์๲฻ a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it demands two obstacles to be moved away
That of ۰ژډ ٪عۤ صک؉ the observer's political vision and the magistrate's factual interpretation.
It remains then the required tool of ऩ८ ऱ२ the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measurement ֣ ה ׄ of its non-observance in all magistrates' judicial proceedings, including the public prosecutor, forces a distinction to be made between the error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be in vain to claim that acts ៮឴ ឯឣ ៕ថ of justice are not divided among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance do not fall under an objective analysis.
And if therefore all ó´ this is not analyzed, how can it be claimed that justice is improving in France?
If ক it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low down.
The ႕ၪာ စၷ႔ ဌႃံ preceding preamble makes it possible to include what follows in the third ratio.
That of the corruption* of Ⴑ პ Ⴜ the magistrates.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power to cause harm* ဃဠ၅ ွႊှ granted to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The ๋อ๱ ๵ๆภ field considered is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed even by means of fraud in the proceeding* by inheritance genealogists appointed by notaries.
This ৾ ত ঢ professions obtains, in a good or bad year, 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover* ensured by the virtual judicial impunity* of the French notaries.
To understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following ずぇ にぞ the first publication.
Where that joins the aforementioned statistical* improvement moderated by the preceding comment ৒৉ ঙ৕ ওল is that the judicial institution produced, during the many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to have themselves spoliated in this way, a whole range of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws in favor of heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics which ignore this type of rational criteria not then an Ͻω elaborate form of lying?
Absolutely awful prices certainly.
More rip-off equipment for disabled people.
You can say that, but ¿á Þ© Á¡ my brother has one of the mountain trikes, built to his dimensions and weight and it has really opened up the outdoors in a way that chunky wheels and tires on a normal wheelchair can't touch.

The Whill looks like ҮЬҐ ғѨ҉ it has been designed by someone who has never cleaned dog poo out of wheel tread.
I'm sure my ヴ sister would love the mountain trike but just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be good for a disabled person with a hankering for longboarding.
We've got hills here that would give them ը Ճ a thrill.
Prices do seem high but people DO send that sort of ձգ՜ ։Ջց money on a bicycle, so "y'know".
I can especially see a case for the Mountain Trike.
Not all disabled people are poor though.
Many have a reasonable insurance pay-out to utilize.
Only if they became Disabled.
The fact is that the ΜΊ wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
The Whill could hardly be 뷖퍝봕 described as minimalist.
It's an example of ႔ႉ ထ၈ ဤႎ over-designing.
sadly it’s just a concept design, with no plans for manufacture.
I'm GLAD that "long distance" wheelchair isn't ձբբ going into the market, as there appears to be no way to steer the damn thing.

In fact, we do not know ҥҵЂ цҥӂ very much about what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where do you get that from?
Because ჸჼჇ the Germans refused to pick up any survivors.
I'm not sure if Spee 'refused' to pick up survivors as such.
One aspect ѥҌӈ of the battle was that neither side appeared to sure of the exact strength their enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee left the 恉枇萊 頄楋鏷 濘盶雽 area promptly because he had received a report of a British battleship in the area.
The Яҏӄ ъЉЮ штҋ seas were stormy earlier in the day - not sure whether this was still the case when the battle concluded?
Equally, combat ended after dark so મ૗ ૻૂ ઞવ this would make any rescue operation more difficult.
Contrast this with the subsequent Battle of the Falklands, where ѐӃҍ photos of survivors being picked up show millpond-like seas and broad daylight.
Moreover, the rescuers knew there were no more German combatants in the area by that ղՉ չ֍ stage.
Hmm, not how I remembered Πϝ what I had read of the battle so I did a quick wiki:
There was some confusion amongst the German ships ै ु as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark once they ceased firing, and a hunt began.
Leipzig saw something burning, but on ぴ ん approaching found only wreckage.
Nürnberg—slower than the other German ships—arrived late at the battle ة،٨ ۤڝ؀ ؜ڃغ and sighted Monmouth, listing and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointedly directing his searchlights 衳秓 赱劼 鄀櫜 at the ship's ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without firm information, von Spee decided that Good Hope had escaped and called off the search ईस लऔ फँ at 22:15.
Mindful of the reports that a British battleship was around somewhere, he ϸζ΍ ϝϑΝ ϳΡ΁ turned north.
So if that is accurate the ٔ۴ت Germans, fumbling around in the dark before radar, did not know that one ship had sunk, so could not have searched for survivors from her.
They also believed that there 橔涰 was a bigger RN battleship in the area which could have caused them serious damage, so in the confusion they quit while they were ahead.
They were a long way from home and Spee was acutely aware that they had a lot of RN ships to get ミ passed on the way.
Cradock's sacrifice had already done them great damage by soaking up ぐなつ about half their ammunition, dooming them when they were eventually caught.
Several ־֮ ׈֐ ׌ז voices are speaking out in the UMP to ask for it to be written in the law that a definitively sentenced elected representative is definitively ineligible as a result of this fact.
That's a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives from the left of course.
But noooo, it is a joke.
FOR THIS จ๯๑ ฑตข ฽๥๝ IDEA I SUGGEST AN INCLUSION ON THE MAGISTRATES' WALL OF CUNTS
When will unions be prohibited in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion ઑ of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by 璛朹搡 political schemers whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to soften up the same people who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of genuine politicians, who really try to get things moving, not the smooth talkers whose inaction is on the same scale as their inadequacy.
I met with them ៩៥ on the metro around midday with their little signs "money for justice", they came from the provinces and did not make the distinction between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports ֡קת the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power that they have at the service of their party.
She ៳៩ would not defend the same theses if right-wing unions, even from the extreme right, were choosing figures from their side as their target and were waging a legal-media war against them.
Your assertions are totally gratuitous.
If ฟฯ ๧๸ the right is currently the main topic in legal developments, this is simply because it has committed acts which pertain to it!
There are no examples of figures from the left who have ष ६ ॱ had so much to do with the Law, but all those who were the object of its attention did not receive preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that 梏 眪 犺 the magistrates' union, which is left-wing, is not the only magistrates' union and that it is a minority.
That a minister should support the unions with such commitment shows to 챪쾱 앇뫢 뵟업 what extent they can be useful.
@MCR The ճՎԳ union which you cite may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancery, this is not a secret.
The question now is if the ϼΫ Ϝϓ ϖΏ "mission" of some judges is not more to smear rather than investigate.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority. 😠😶
What ႜ႗ဆ ီဒွ are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you are forgetting that magistrates are ¼ not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones to have the power to indict and to incarcerate everyone.

And worse than ridiculous: this establishes ճճ a completely artificial distance between the western audience and the peoples studied – a distance which turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralized ethnologists present these remote people as immensely superstitious and filled with ritual bigotry, while the majority of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical daily considerations.

Who still believes ৥ the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would cast aside interpretations that are not at all scientific 泘乩 釣魬 and last the lifetime of a mandarin, rarely less.
When will there be a comparative criticism of the disciplines so that we can laugh 괙 a little?
Because what holds for archeology also holds for the interpretations that other disciplines give. Ⴢ ძ
That would bring a beneficial dose of modesty.
Your ៜ៛ contempt for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly Ѹѱҷ ТӓҖ ҍЊн discover treasures, precious testimonies to rebuild History, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is exciting.
This method is not ជ៩ឫ ិ៊ឋ very old and before archaeologists trusted their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and ם֕ scientific means that are so effective that interpreting excavations is better but can still be called into question by other discoveries!

If the FOM chose not to ۮ ث show these images, it is only to protect its interests, on no account the driver's.
If the くぞぅ そおし FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at the moment when another vehicle (breakdown lorry, for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon, юЌ҇ which was known was coming, but for which the FOM did not deem it appropriate to bring forward the starting time (television rights, adverts, money...).
But apart from that they um Gd protect the drivers well.
Well 🙆 read, I also share this opinion.
But also that if the very 😊😪 😹😗 British FOM makes the SC enter, it is going to enable Nico Rosberg at the restart to have a chance of beating the Englishman, who was leading then...
Your really let go on this =/ blog my dear Dayrton.

No, just ۽ ٺ ۨ no.
There were loads ងឫៈ ៷តែ of conspiracies in F1, but never one which puts stewards in danger of death for a remote story of the possibility of the victory of a driver to the detriment of another.
It 뉹뎖뤾 봁톮쿵 쳨꿪앒 is not the FOM that takes out the safety car it is the FIA.
Significant difference.
In view of amateur images, the lack of images enables the FIA above all to ៹ ឝ ឹ avoid annoying questions such as: How is it possible that the steward is waving a green flag mid-operation and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the ឌោឈ ឡ៱៩ accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can continue normally and that it is no longer under the control of the yellow flag.
Certain comments ૉ૚ઓ ઊૄૅ show a dark ignorance of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race ៎ ៭ ះ is no longer under the control of the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag is flown.
This is the usual procedure.
The stewards' post just after the accident (depending on the case, this can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) is waving the green to tell the drivers to resume a normal speed.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think ញឝ that the media were an integral part of the government's 'patriotic' propaganda offensive but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just the money.
And sex, lets not forget sex, fear of not getting sex, adverts and 쥎 쪡 뵉 the media are good at selling us things that may lead us to better sex.
The news ऒँ does the very same thing.
Hyping things up that the public really don't need to fret about and that's all about keeping ॎ ॅ people scared so they remain controllable.
"When the tabloids cough up an Ebola story, we all 😶😀😵 😁😌😅 catch the fear" Should be “cook up”, not “cough up”.
Given the health connotations of the word 'cough', 'cough up' is a far more ԳՒջ ցկՐ Օմֈ effective turn of phrase than 'cook up' in this context...
I wonder if all the people yelling that Ebola may become इॽ॥ ॎ३५ airborne realise they now believe in evolution?
You are giving them too much credit.

I think ゛ゎぐ けり゛ れぇか it makes perfect sense that if we are to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence in the absence of any acts of terrorism, why not have an ebola crisis in the absence of any cases?

My ტ ჸ ჼ psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This ั is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say that ラケテ ンラビ it is nonsense, it is a subjective testimony without importance.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this ૜ભૃ testimony, which proves the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) serves no purpose in a scientific procedure?
On what do you base your research, then?
On fantasies?
Do you place fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies) on the same level?
"Resilience": the ぶゅぶ ゝりは phony word adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after having read D'ansembourg.

Cyrulnik did the "resilience" 봪잋 trick on us.
As he is a жӳӃ ѳѵѩ бӝю great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have knocked together a reliable measuring scale to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if Thunderbirds could save us all from farage and co.??
Team America anyone?
Seriously, thunderbirds is *not* a ჋ ზ Ⴤ good thing to bring back...
Why on Earth not?
It was a wonderful series and it ¦íç ­Íç seems to being brought back by people who recognise that!
Leave the saving to the almighty who deals with miracles.
How are they going to make it successful with children though?
I can only see them ฯมร ฤัพ ใ๗ฐ introduce toilet humour and the like which will wreck it.
It was already a children's show.

Looking forward to this (even 즘욥뉥 뮳뭄붗 툱잯휦 as a grown up), but I hope this also inspires one of the channels to re-run the originals.
It's virtually never ղ Ի ֊ been off the air here in Australia - for at least the last 40 years, we've had hour-long episodes on Saturdays & Sundays at 0600.
Since the advent of digital free-to-air TV चईए a few years ago, it has been moved to one of the secondary commercial channels & still screens at those times.
The bonus is that half-hour episodes are now on at 0530, Monday to Friday!
Yes, I am ચ૝ર probably a "sad" 60 year old bloke, but I don't watch it every day!
There ¨ Ï is no "Temple Mount" in or under the esplanade of mosques!!!
Radical Zionists invented it to give themselves Ⴤ჋ Ⴑ჊ ჵႱ political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations underneath and ៹ around the esplanade of mosques for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The 😘😹🙋 😐😙😍 😊😳🙍 temple mount, if it exists, it is elsewhere.
Perhaps in Argentina?
This mount is ႎဗၒ ၗဓဴ ထွၔ not looked for due to the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, ΧΎ or the dome of the Rock, juts out in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mohammed went up to ナード ェァソ heaven from this rock.
For Jews, it is the mount ষ ৠ আ Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
From the moment when it ќ Ћ was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its 癵 extremists, it is good to remember that regularly, and they unfortunately took over in the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scrapped it continually!).
It is å also to show to what extent the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The ÓÝ shortest Jewish joke: "Praise be to God!"
To ჩჴ praise tourism in Israel to us, we are often shown half-undressed young nymphs, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usually, quite 툺띚장 뛄얖츤 쪴좐쓫 different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen on the photo which illustrates the article.
It is a 쐜쀵훢 띊륮솜 bit scary all the same.
And this photo is a magnificent propaganda campaign!
Shame that Ⴍ ჭ the Reuters photographer did not take a photo of the hundreds of Palestinians authorized to go back to the temple Mount and who prefer to stone faithful Jews down below, praying at the wailing Wall.
@Mat, If this photo disturbs you, it has every right to do so, it is 絻沥 嗱抽 箇億 neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This is H not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way ìÜ Î¦ to end it is revolution.
Since the economy apparently 醉眭枍 went to shit big business has hugely taken advantage of their employees.
They have managed to ភ convince their workers that they are lucky to have a job and that they can't afford to be given pay rises, whilst at the same time and in plain sight, they have awarded the elite few at the top bigger and bigger rewards.
You are right it is ဪယ not sustainable, but it will only end in this country when the working classes actually speak with one voice.
Rather than bitch and moan about somebody else's Ⴗ ჈ industrial action, support it, show a bit of solidarity and recognise that their action is not only dealing with their issues, but is also showing your employer there are consequences for taking the piss.
Not if ΢Ί Ϭώ we get rid of democracy, then it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only point you missed was how UK òî and US business sold our manufacturing and now our service jobs off to countries with the worst, most polluting places with cheapest most exploited workers.
China and India come to Ⴌ ვ Ⴋ mind.
There 🙁😌 😹😋 is no way this is going to end well.
It's because we don't have democracy ჎჎ that it has been sustained.
Did you vote for TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade ΛͿΪ and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is intended to increase the profits of the corporations that these people own by overriding national governments through secret courts.
That sounds unbelievable but it is exactly what the Investor-State ่ Dispute Settlement (ISDS) part of the deal is intended for.
The the Green ぜっぷ ぜゆせ けょぅ party is opposed to it and trying to alert people to the incredible devastation it will wreak on our lives.

This man is 虲婜 愆蝛 堀伄 right, in the 18th there were unions in all the regiments
In the ါးှ very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (well, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe that it is the safe Ϛ΁ ͲϞ Ϫϼ of France's eternal values, and it will fight and shut up.
And then with the decline of the country, シ・ globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, to have this small relic, it's comforting.
Even if for it, it is more ၳၾ ၮၖ ၊ဗ and more uncomfortable...
You are still ઍક missing the union of married men, single men, married women, single women, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you do not write French correctly, ૔ ભ I'll form a union.
You have been warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of interest groups, we ڳږ ۆد already have to put up with protected professions equipped with unions quite enough, which created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are requested ՗ժ not to laugh about a civil servant's fear of risk.
One can very easily imagine a ॾ॑ॢ ॐप॔ system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or without the right to strike like in Germany, in exchange for the protection which they enjoy.
Otherwise catastrophe is ensured.
And with the charrettes which are prepared, the ゕゅび ろびゖ ぁ゘れ government congratulates itself.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance. Sybille I was referring to soldiers ၃ၔ႘ and other civil servants, as this is the subject commented on here...
If we remove "through its delegates" in article ゠ユ 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.

This is absolutely essential with the irruption of informative power.
And ៯រ ប៫ yet you open, presumably read and then post on an article specifically titled 'the great British bake off review'. ?????
Look, it was just lying there, empty.
I thought it could do with a conversation starter.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched - there was some top, top, top, baking action on that episode
Joffrey's wedding episode features one of the finest show-stoppers (albeit misdirection - it was the wine) in TV history.
Also, mmm pie.
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
Second final in a row where strangely Ў it almost seems like the least worst baker on the day wins - no - one seemed to go "bang - here's my big bastard of a cake now bang it in your mouth and bow to the best" !
Perhaps the ધ added pressure of friends and family outside finally gets to them?
In previous weeks all those 🙈😩 🙁😹 outsiders have been kept away.
Plus there's the feeling of 'stay safe, there's always ա Ծ ՘ next week' which disappears on the final week.
I love baking but can't imagine putting myself through this.
I remain grateful to this who do ΀ϒ Ϡϴ ϑΑ and who give us some lovely entertainment and inspire us to try something different next time.
Roll on GBBO15!
Id agree, last years final challenge, the wedding cake, was ludicrous. |?J AzL
Professionals usually take days to ٹ٘ ىٙ ١؋ make them and they were expected to knock one together in 3-4 hours.
The three showstoppers ฮ ื ษ were all so neck and neck I couldn't imagine how they'd pick a winner.
Luis' bottom layer being a bit dry was the only ဦ ည real fault they found (though I agreed with Hollywood that the lime green icing on Richard's windmill was a bit off putting, though Richard had already blown it by that point).

There is also cancer which lies in wait, with 뛙욜 the gusts of solar wind.
We are certainly succeeding at everything at the moment.
A bad  Â moment for humanity to go through is expected.
You are mixing solar wind and ultraviolet rays up.
UV rays are mainly blocked by the ղպ ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV rays.
So, even if the ペ ヱ magnetic field gets weaker, there would not be enough solar wind to "get rid of" the stratospheric ozone.
There would be even more, and ऒय॒ ५ऽण क़ढ़क़ therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately the ozone layer does ΰϠϺ ΣΈ΅ οφϷ not block UV rays.
They ৒খ৯ have loads of useful functions that you cannot even imagine.
If ૳ છ we limit ourselves to man, they are concerned with allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), heating us (apart from infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morale.
The ozone layer blocks য৥ণ the carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and the majority of UVB through.
Do you know κβ πΧ Ͻλ that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a backward person when you post a comment?
Above all for a minor ႖ clarification which was implied in the comment, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying Í º ¼ that I know melanomas well, UV rays only ACCELERATE their development.
They do not CAUSE them.
As proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanomas.
That is to say, when a doctor tells you that it is necessary to avoid the ± ñ sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen as UV rays are necessary for every human.
Excess, on the ڧٛ other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanomas. ডয়
Does it bend?
More importantly, will it blend?
or blend...
I ׾ֶ׸ think the majority of the attention paying population have established, that anything will bend if enough force is applied to it and the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable in its strength, for the use to which it was intended.
I believe the military may require something more ؼڭ hard wearing and as such haven't adopted the iPhone6 yet as its choice in frontline communications.
For the rest of us.
It's a good choice.

It's quite difficult to see how a prototype could get anywhere near the distribution operation.
By the time the special software is being installed, 굄긱촲 뻺쌉닅 you would think the phone would be clear of the main production line, and it's difficult to imagine how it would get back into it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
More likely it is a production unit that hasn't had the iOS software installed correctly and is stuck with the ૴ ઩ factory test code installed.
I have no idea how they ื ถ ๑ make these things.
Would they have test software on every single one, though?
The photographs on ebay 职阷簖 鱃郉诲 踘孅烸 clearly show the absence of the FCC/CE logo's and a red prototype connector.
Ah the quintessential article for bohos.
We want cheap products and Ⴞჯ ჇჍ we are surprised that the factory-produced ones are produced in factories. We put super u forward, but all brands and even small-scale trade are concerned. How to eat well, bio with €1,650 (average salary in France)?
But to ´Á ¨¯ §þ reply to your post, it is possible to eat well with a small salary.
Afterwards, ၃ everyone is free to set their priorities where they like.
For me food is one of them.
OK then no hard feelings, I send you ेड ऑख़ a kiss
We call #aR bohos, or rather eco-bohos, people who see the world through an ideological "software program", which leads them to disconnect themselves from realities.
It is the full unbundling of thought-reason.
They are experts in Ϯ΅΀ θΟΜ ϰϹϽ gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided having a shower.
They are also experts in hypocrisy, agreeing with the caviar left, from which they sometimes come, for example by หซฉ ๶ฒ๝ condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast ॴॽॅ च३श ैन॒ majority of our fellow citizens do not put up with this mixture of oafish ideology and hypocrisy, therefore do not be surprised if you often find criticisms on them.
Wow, thank ѕ ѡ ҋ for this complete and exhaustive theorization and for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I would really like to be a part of them, but I cannot find my way around them. 췸릀붍
The 🙍😛 concept is not that complicated.
The eco-bohos are cast in one piece.
Did you understand the ض ؋ concept of the caviar left?
Well Ҥїв ҈ҧИ ЋИҧ then, you are in a position to understand the eco-boho concept.
It is a perfect copy with ষৡ আৰ just an ideological nuance.
The 😚🙊🙅 classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists full stop.
The eco-boho ៏៺ ឹ៕ is part of it, but only represents the most visible fringe of ecologists, as it is this one which infests the media.

The fact that Emin can't draw and seems ॾ obsessed with the same subject matter is not the point.
The point is, she actually managed to make herself fabulously wealthy and famous on the back of no artistic ability.
That's *art*.

The fact that Emin can't draw

Unless you are only capable of ။႘ ၚ၈ ၃ၑ appreciating lifelike recreations of smoking dogs playing pool.
There can be a problem with the institution of art appreciation but not in ។៛ ៖ះ this case.
Drawing encompasses more than mere representation. デヴダ ルッォ ィナロ

There are still things to economize on: horse-riding activities, the number of republican guard ค ซ ฤ horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service...

A 륍쟆빫 unique approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.

Where is - _ the promised enshrinement?
@edmond: that is what I was saying, look elsewhere or economize, but above all not in my backyard, my backyard is really not ઢ ૻ ૑ possible...
This is exactly what you suggest doing, look 🙈 elsewhere where chaos is certain.
Let all ø those who mixed more or less with the military thing dare to come and say here, face to face, that there is no money wasted in this area and without bursting out laughing...
If we apply the same potion to the whole civil service and the ڔإ ؛ب ؒأ public finances will be a bit better.
And for ϭ ϫ Josi: really irritating: look at the inflated public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why Defence may regard itself as a little full!
Well ៛វ៸ ឵ូឝ ៴៦៣ yes, economies that everyone agrees to say that they must be made, that should be seen somewhere, no?

That awkward moment when the first ၰဃ three commenters make the same bad joke.
That life sapping moment when you scroll down your Facebook feed and learn that 80% of your friends have started their posts with the phrase "That awkward moment".
I gather there's now ऽऺ ू१ ऺि a film with that title.
It probably relies on hilarious scenes involving people bumping into their ex's on শভঁ ৳ঠঁ the bus and getting to work only to discover they have tucked their skirt into their pants.
That's not fucking awkward, it's brain-dead.
Not really, to me it sounds like the writer is playing the role of 😠 😙 the usual British male brought up to downplay emotions and bite the lip.

I beg you to stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited 靐 to CO2.
Radioactivity is much ¡ Ü ó more harmful with respect to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit ৕৲৫ it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only づす salvation, provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity with renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity means zero CO2 emissions during production and epsilon for the other stages. ҂ ӹ Ӈ
Renewable wind or R" 8J PV electricity already means more GHGs in the other stages and above all gas, or worse, coal, like in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing ឱៗ ី៏ nuclear with renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial, I am not insulting you. I have a State บ ๭ ฬ Doctorate in physical sciences 1981. In addition, I've done research on nuclear physics, I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not ϼ say, it is you who lends me ideas. I did not say anything about Germany, nothing at all in fact. You have not replied to what I was saying and like all right-wingers I never destroy the interlocutor.
I quote furthermore the conclusion of experts appointed by Ψ Ͱ ϕ the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and ineffective means to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and Չի construction and if you do not count the water vapor greenhouse gas with less of an effect than CO2. It is true, reminder: two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear plant leaves as water vapor and a little in the water of rivers.
Didn't read after you referred Pakistan as "SOUTH ASIAN GIANT "... !!
Pakistan won the last football series against Hindustan. ီၗ
Yeah why would you, most Indian ৒ ঀ ৓ Commenters just want to read and comment on something that's against Pakistan.
Shows ڒ؆ٟ your mentality by the way.
Would have done the same thing if they called India as South Asian Giant...
I have no issues with individual Pakistani players playing but a Pakistani franchise is a strict no-no. ઴઀ ૂ૗ ઙઇ

As for the ISL, today's opening Î match was a surprisingly entertaining affair with Athletico de Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.

That is ៉ំ៺ ឳំ៌ all the more regrettable since a lot of the media constantly go back over only the titles of articles - and that many readers only remember the titles.
All in all that creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, ์ฝฮ ฟเแ ๽ผ๖ it unjustly calls into question the project, while it is only a problem with the launcher.
