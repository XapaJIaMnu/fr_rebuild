This is perfectly illustrated by the UKIP numbties banning φ΋ϠΕ ΝεͺϏ Ϫιψο people with HIV.
You mean Nigel Farage saying the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK as health tourists, and saying yes when the interviewer specifically asked if, with the aforementioned in mind, people with HIV were included in not being welcome.
You raise a straw man and then knock it down with thinly veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need to use the NHS we have to queue up behind bigots with a sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.
I think the straw man is yours.
Health tourism as defined ၽ႓ဘည ဪႈ၆၇ ီွ့ႂ by the right wing loonies is virtually none existent.
I think it's called democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's policies against health tourism so no problem.

With the agreement of Brussels, the lowest taxes on companies ÔÞÝï öö° in Europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, there is nothing to "crow about" for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s in the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal. Considering a ष॥ख़ईॻ constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it ever was.

Latvia has a 0% tax rate for companies.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay.

Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: le Marais is largely pedestrianized, and is literally swarming with people.
The people have not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (ordinary, for プドビヽロムソヸモシ the most part) or for the Journal fair at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly outmoded).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the area સ૖ઓખ૰ is incredibly lively and animated. 🙅🙀😐😐🙀
With a lot of foreigners who spend...
Do you think that opening on Sundays is going to create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of people ៦ញ៮។ with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign ÃýÍÐí¸ óÁãÐ¥½ â¥ÄÚíø tourists and this is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax-free.
Tourist areas lose âÙ¯ÑæøÕ ÁÞ¿¼¸èÛ ßÈ¨È÷ÂÇ a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons.
The industry remains, where expensive equipment, used on Sunday, makes it possible to lower [E_'6sMcS4 68)I2]tRfM prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees, besides exceptions, enjoy.
That's the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code.
Neither the ministry responsible for the economy, nor, moreover, ઍઆ૰ઝૃ૴૛ ૼૂરૐ૎૜૑ the one responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence ͵ϻΌͼύϏ to reform the labor code. ๢ีา๻๎฀๡ผ฀๋ ๸ญ฻พึล๒๦๼๐ ๓ว๐ฝขฅ

A single track for training teachers: move sophists and ideologues away from the training and let practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice reread the paragraph on placements (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us towards the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device which leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not enable the Ϙ΂ΦϬ΋ͱ Ο϶ϚΓβϕ system to make progress".

If यैृॐॗड़ॴ९॰छ I ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement I just need to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
Just the same as they are required to properly reference sources.
In many cases it costs nothing to properly licence content.
No, it's copyright infringement.
Not נֹ֔מ֝פ׫֘ ױ֢֡ךפ׸ֲ֝ the same thing at all.
When you use content without properly licensing it you are depriving the artists of their living.
You can argue the pedantic ifs and buts to justify yourself - but it's theft.

It's copyright infringement.

According to the link provided in the article:
To its credit, Airbnb's response to 鮂勐噀 饡赧窦 Teman was quick, almost absurdly so.
Within 24 hours, per an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had ช๾฽ู๑รํฆ๵เ ๫ลฅวน่๔เฃ๖ sent a locksmith to change his locks, made plans to put him up in a hotel for ઺સૣસ૙લ૏ ૽યિ઩ડ઩ર a week, and wired him $23,817 (of which Airbnb itself is insured, but nonetheless).
So why is this article quoting Teman as complaining that there was no support from Airbnb?

Personally, I cannot see the inhabitants of the very depths of Essonne ぐすきおび ろがでぉの ゅねゞょか and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km there and back every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.

Yeah but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines are not at fault, the fault lies with the authority tasked with the safety of the air space, in this case the government of Ukraine.

As far as I know there is already a legal action against Kiev's government as they are responsible for what goes on in their skies.

Rather disappointed by this opening to season 4 and particularly by Jessica Lange who visibly found કગ૫ફધડઇ૮ ૐક૱આૡ૭ણ૘ it difficult to find her double character, Marlene Dietrich.
I have just watched शऀॎी४मझ ॣ०ऽवौऊफ़ the last two seasons, which are quite different, うゆ ぜぉ but I must admit ૼ૮લ that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and 😀😲 the だょ りで show with Jessica Lange singing 😑😳🙅😦🙁😒😏 😊😽😇🙄😴😸😔 😣😶😙😿😴😃😼 the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is quite simply amazing.
I haven't watched this new series yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange meh).
In the ١ٌڳ٘خ خڝۦ۲ں ۸ۡ٭ٙڒ case of American Horror Story I preferred to watch it all in one go to watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, apart from extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks in the staging and editing which stagger me.
In AHS we have an avalanche of original shots which ridicule the aseptization of today's productions quite well.
I don't quite understand why you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly ၂႖က႔႕ဈဠရ ႔ံ႘ၚဉ၏၀ဤ one of the mainstays in this ւՁ նՎ series, but, 😉😍😊🙆😑😫 as you said so well, there are many other things.
No, it is simply that, for me, Jessica Lange (and above all her ઝુઉ ૽઩ઍ ૠ૬ૡ voice and ़। दॶ ऻअ the way in which she uses it) is びぬひぷぢでだづ びびなてゃ゚はま truly ONE of the pillars of the series apart from some technical ゑげにゞ ぀む぀び qualities.
And well I watch it a lot for ֽֿׯ׺ֲן׾ צ׻״ָי֕ה her.
Then I find that the series is flawed by its writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below par, in the 꿗뀬뜆잩폄눱 싕휷꺭옢쥑둴 퇾뮃뵮죢풖믿 2nd 13_aX/ it was too fragmented despite some excellent 🙊😴😴😱😫😘😘 episodes.
I do not see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or 7xCHIC it is going ҌӁїөӄӱ҂Ӿ to finish like ՘չՒՈՖ 24 otherwise.
But anyway everyone does what they want ৙ঘধ৊ৄর৵ণঈ঵ গ঑ঌঁ৤ফ঻঒কয় to, eh!
It is not because I z{L%kYa t7JA3M' say "I will not watch anymore afterwards" that everyone is obliged to do 😞😊😨😳😑😑🙃🙆 🙁😓🙊😰😣😅😭😩 😬😈🙎😰😱😥😏😈 the same!
I simply ๣๏ ๖๢ ผ๗ share my point of ၜထၠၪဉ၄ ၧပႍၗၗရ တၵ၆ၻ၍အ view, nothing more, nothing less.

Picking noisy fights over relatively modest chunks of expenditure, such as foreign aid
The problem is that it is less than the margin ン・スプァョ of error for Government expenditure in the UK.
The ْٰڑ reality is that we are all talking about a differnece in emphasis rather than the change in direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all ֺֿ׌׹ג֪״׊ ֱ׼ֿ־׺֥טװ ׹׹כִ׸ֲ֧׵ sides ・ヮ ヸヅ ボポ pretend that the difference is emphasis is something much more significant and substantial - and the voters see through that as being disingenuous.

The "debt" are assets held mainly by financial institutions in this 뭓뜮 봁늇 country.
The "debt" is nothing to panic ၐၗၨ ီေည ီံေ about.
I would be relaxed about the government appropriating one third of ゲァノセヵヷェ my income (before we get on to taxes on spending) if I felt it would use it wisely.
But I don't and many taxpayers feel the same.
Nigel Farage is alleged to be less than honest about how taxes can be reduced but then again if you add up our EU net contribution, overseas aid, HS2, subsidies to near-useless wind farms and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should you come to a figure that makes Labour's / Lib-Dem's mansion tax seem very small beer.

Northern soul is still alive, but it has 긬넦됛풉과쐌뷊뛠 뗰즩랎쫏예찈닾갡 been vampired by capitalism, and ៯៲យ៺៸០ is now largely a surface Аұѷоөѻ ҵУҫӮіь phenomena.

It's about a lot more than Russell Brand as well, yet the ួ៞៏រ ឫៅួៗ Guardian's writers ჰჩსჶჇ ზႽპႵჂ seem to struggle to get beyond anything he ΌΫ΋ϱΑ doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says is ghostwritten sub-Chomskyian woo
This shows you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
Just a collection of personal attacks ৽ৌএ৮ৢ and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, implying it's to do with immaturity).
A really mean spirited attack, with just a hint of awareness that ざざくのらも えゐねほに゜ Russell Brand is speaking some truth, maybe a truth ႲႾაჭ შႨ჌Ⴚ that is too much to think about.
Hold on to your hat, there's going to be a lot more of this sentiment coming!
I can understand why Brand rubs some people up the wrong way - can be pretentious in his delivery and after all the tabloid nonsense he does come across as a johnny-come-lately populist, but this ჳჄ჉ჺჶႶზჯჸ ႹლႸႦႳდႹთ჏ whole not voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems յթ to be that he is just telling people not to vote and to ЈӶщѕЉ дӠҿѡи put their feet up instead and ៮ៀអ៬ឺ៽៭ិ ignore the whole political ़ॺ ॰द ॔ॺ process - but if you watch the Paxman interview and other articles/videos he's posted, he's saying merely voting once every 5 years for Labour or Conservative (or the Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely ၲျႌ ၾဧႀ pointless, as both parties (to slightly differing extents) are basically ruling for vested interests, corporate multi-nationals and ラケパフヴペ the wealthy, At no ՘՟Կշյ՚ՒՅՉ ֍պսյ֋Ձՙսպ point does he just say ignore politics completely დႾჯჵდ ႠႸძჄპ ოჱრჳႢ as these parties aren't ծՋֈեխԺ։սՌ սՂյ՟Պ՟ՄՂե թշԿ֎՘մ՝ԹԲ ruling in our name - he makes a big point of saying that ҋӒҎыҞ гӇҍӏ҆ instead of merely voting and switching off for 5 years, people should become far more politically active from a grassroots level, agitate, protest, petition, whatever and try to influence politics from this level.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (as I ៰៴ៜឮ៘ំ៺ រ៼៾៞ងៈជ think 😨😹😦😽😇😲😻😨😼😯 😶🙆😹🙋🙎🙍😰😉🙈😆 😽😩😥😘🙂😓😖🙁😚😆 being politically active in terms of making demands can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fickle lot who will change their tune if there is a real 쿵덧케뚐뿲쵠 쨸홏몒먿뉶씻 끈걳솿귅쀞쁿 prospect of them being voted out of office), but it is annoying seeing all nN20;oL],7  <!:MOH En these ギガゾエァヽセェガ ーヤトヨツユヽンユ ルマスヤクリハドク patronising responses saying the silly Jesus man is telling the youth to not bother voting and just hope for the best as it is mis-representing his argument.
His ღნჶႵႫႩ ბხთჇფლ გზყცმჃ solution is extremely debatable, and it would be nice if people would debate what he actually means rather than just label him irresponsible and sideline the concerns that he and a huge amount of disenfranchised people hold.
Yes - thank you.
The voting thing has been entirely misrepresented.
I deeply resent the pointlessness of a cross on a piece of paper every 5 years 鐀扚兌汷 when my vote doesn't even bloody well count.
I want more ৔঱ৱ ৾ঙ৚ referenda on issues, voting by hole in the wall technology, direct democracy よゔふょっがぬ ぜ぀せとぜゆそしぞ うへべじょぼろ ぺぴべゔなゑぉ and MPs locally accountable to the electorate.
Also, I take issue with the suggestion that Russell Brand's words are not his own (ghostwritten).
He's intelligent enough to come up with his own words ពឞ៟ and ideas, even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of 覕袮仳嵕謈鋓苣 櫺蠦皻毹鱐汮鹓 恛盩瀊镎搸麂掿 anti-establishment, countercultural thinkers and academics that Suzanne would happily lump into one "sub-Chomskyian woo" box.

For my part, I saw in Pierre Bourdieu's ¾Ó¯õÞ intellectual attitude, as well as in Michel Foucault's, a need to target a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop ¤ß¤ very rational lines of argument, but 🙆😎😁😛🙃😒 😺😖🙃😸😄😧 😮🙎😬🙂🙂😧 this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are bCmEuFkX ?J[A)Q&e gtqFl@l# the keystone of their ڌ۝ٛٹ۫۶َٺھ ۮڸى؊چء؆ٙڲ ۖڵۃِؿ٣َۑغ thoughts.

This stems ๷ภบ ฉดฆ ยฬศ from a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magic thinking.
The problem with the relationship with the Z>oV:8*Ks ee='p\s)5 other is ๤าขง๾ด๔ ๙๏๾ฟิลห ท๒๛ภฌๅถ solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or libertarian inclination (of the two terms the second marks a reinforcement of the desire to eliminate Օ֋ the State, the first knowing how to find help from the State for its deals) meaning less バヲユ State / no 躩巅襦主熯玢夶晠鸞 鸗睗廪曏蟄騟衝誆铔 戚霡燄噽褿鐃闺劂胖 State at all ၻၬှၭယၴ်ၕၷ in Foucault.
The old dream of the base which organizes itself beautifully.

Where there is a culprit, there is also elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not taking a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, those of ϷζϔζͺΫϲϒϣβ ΙϬρϱϻΞϘϛϻϖ God back then, Stalin, the little father of the people.

The attitudes ৩ঢ৞৮ূট ডজআ৏৲ও I've witnessed in Russia towards the Chinese and other "yellows" are absolutely jaw dropping.

No measure for impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the ヂエマヹタブル ギュルマーヂロ ッヒノヌイア・ mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups which are very much left-leaning, such as the magistrates' union...
@Marabout: sorry, but ჼცႻჸღႢႾყႮ ჆ქႼაႳტႰႶႯ the judiciary sectors are frankly right-leaning.
As for the magistrates' union, it only represents 25% of judges.
If a 慠坻熣骳范傕呚怊亚奦 measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the տՆՀ courts, it demands two obstacles to be moved away

It remains then the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measurement of its non-observance еьЕ҅Ѫ ѢӵӣЎЋ in all magistrates' judicial proceedings, including the public prosecutor, forces a distinction to be made between the error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be in vain to claim that acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance do not fall under an objective analysis.
And if therefore all this is not analyzed, how can it be claimed that justice is improving in France?

The seas were stormy earlier in the day ๷๜ำ๡ิฆฯปฉ ฬรฤฮฟ๩ฦ๣ล ๽ฅน๣๶จฎดษ - not ភឍឥឝវគ ើ៘ដៗដ៏ sure whether this was still the case when the battle concluded?
Equally, combat ended after dark so this would make any rescue operation more difficult.
Contrast this with the subsequent Battle of the Falklands, where photos of survivors being picked up show millpond-like seas and broad daylight.
Moreover, the ៦៺៱យ ឲហឌន ៉ភឧប rescuers knew there were no more German combatants ѡҢ ҒЯ ЏЇ in the area by that stage.
Hmm, not how I remembered what I had read of the battle so I 玆擡硶韟鳳着挡囬 鷜蜆况铛軣妟呢磉 葂拰藙罵盛烠剃愝 did a quick wiki:
There was some confusion amongst the German ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark once they ceased firing, and a hunt began.
Leipzig saw something burning, but on approaching found only wreckage.
Nürnberg—slower than the other German ships—arrived late ဒေဤက့စ at the battle and sighted Monmouth, listing and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointedly directing his searchlights at the ship's ׁ֢ײְִֹ׻׼׾֛ ־ִׁ֚ׯ׼ֹֿ֦פ ৽৤ঌ঍৕঎ন ঘৰ৖ঝম৑ৣ ֿ֕׌׉׭ַ״ןײֵ ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without firm information, von Spee decided that Good Hope had escaped and called off the ူႍၻူ့ၹႏ ႘ဋႄ၈ဪၳၱ search at 22:15.
Mindful of the reports that a British battleship was around somewhere, he turned north.
So if that is accurate the Germans, fumbling around in the dark before radar, did not know that one ship ၏ၕနသ ၑ့႖ၐ had sunk, so could not have searched for survivors from her.
They also believed that there was a bigger RN battleship in the area which could have caused them プオコェマヶゲヮヮワ serious damage, so in the confusion they quit while they were ahead.
They were a long way from home and Spee was acutely aware that they had a lot of RN ships to ÀÝ¢õñ³÷ Úé¬³èÍâ get passed on the way.
Cradock's sacrifice had already done them great damage by soaking up about half their ammunition, dooming them when they were eventually caught.
Several voices are speaking out in the UMP to ask for it to be written ӛӕч ӹрӤ љѪӯ in the law that a definitively sentenced elected representative is definitively ineligible as a result of this fact.
That's a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives from the left of course.
But noooo, it is a joke.

When will unions be prohibited in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?

She would not defend ゑぁか ざだあ the same theses if right-wing unions, even from the extreme right, were choosing figures from their side as their target and were waging a legal-media war against them.
Your assertions are totally gratuitous.
If the right is currently the main topic in legal developments, this is simply because it has committed acts which pertain to it!
There are no examples of figures from the left who ჷგგჩႫდ჎Ⴠუ have had so much to do with the Law, but all those who were the object of its attention did not receive preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the magistrates' union, which is left-wing, is not the only magistrates' union and that it is a minority.
That a minister should support the unions with such commitment shows to what extent they ՎևՏ՚֎Խս՝ՎՒ զ֍՘րիխփՕՋտ ֎։պԵռՄ՛֊ֆփ can be useful.

Because what holds for archeology also holds for the interpretations that other disciplines give.
That would bring a beneficial dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!

If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at ضژ ٸٮ the moment when another vehicle (breakdown lorry, for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon, which was known was coming, but for which the FOM did not deem it appropriate to bring forward the starting time (television rights, adverts, money...).
But apart from that they protect the drivers well.
Well read, I also share this opinion.

It is not the ો૳આવૃૠ૙ ેય઩૸ૹથક FOM that takes out the safety car it is the ՞֊՜ ւՌԿ Ո֍Չ FIA.
Significant difference.
In view of amateur images, ૖ૈ the lack of images enables the FIA above all to avoid annoying questions such as: How is it possible that the steward is waving a green flag ယ႓ၙ mid-operation and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video ჟႢႾჀოႸ ხჱძჺ჎Ⴍ after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed ձՃիՂօ՝՚ ՘֍՚ղՌթԽ ։՚֍ԹմՎմ too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving 葌衷只鯦髞蟲匂錊唸疬 濳苦蛨濶缜慕睑豫殶瘵 a green flag, ႙ဵၝ ဧၰ၆ ၘဿ့ a sign ӱӒВѠѐѕѶҌ that ボェゥベ マハガヽ ョヵトゴ the कॉऻ ौख़च race can continue normally and that it is no longer under the control of the yellow flag.

This is the usual procedure.
The stewards' post just after the accident (depending on the case, this can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) is waving the green to tell the drivers to resume a normal speed.
Sensationalism sells advertising.

Given the ဢှ၂ဗ၅ဢႌ၂ေ ခဎ႖႑ၝအါၙၒ health connotations of the word 'cough', 'cough up' is a far more effective turn of phrase than 'cook up' in this context...

A perfectly useless testimony.
Like whenever science is talked about.
Not only 졥뮳객젙쐓됤 do testimonies serve no good: taken on their own, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a damaging influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
This is maybe why one refrains from posing questions to psychiatric patients when one has reliable 컵뼧쮇굺 observations from close relatives.

There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the esplanade of mosques!!!
Radical Zionists invented it to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations underneath and around the 塮吺絘賤咢 帩珡铊鉩柍 痸繥呼之娕 esplanade of mosques for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The temple mount, if it exists, it is elsewhere.
Perhaps in Argentina?
This mount is not looked for due to the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of Λϐϵη αͱͿͳ mosques was built.
Its summit, or the dome of the Rock, juts out in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mohammed went up to းှႛ၎ခၠ ဓဿၦ၄၂ၸ heaven from this rock.
For Jews, it is the mount ׈טףָ׬ׯ֠֨ ׫ה֬׍׮ֵ׊׹ ַ֭֙א׷הַ֘ Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
From the moment when it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.

In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (well, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe that it is the safe of France's eternal values, and it will fight and ჊ႳზႣჵ ჽჹშჴႥ shut up.
And then with the ၓၷၕ decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, to have this small relic, it's comforting.
Even ๥ิฮฑั if ナハザモ リガチサ for it, it is more and more uncomfortable...

If you do not write French correctly, I'll form a union.

For the defence of interest groups, ং঒ীৣৎৎ ঺এট৭ঽর we already have to put up with protected professions equipped with unions quite enough, which created a breach of equality with other citizens.

And yet you open, presumably read and then post on an article specifically titled 'the great British bake off review'. ?????
Look, it was just lying there, empty.
I thought it could do with a conversation starter.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched - there was some top, top, top, baking action on that episode
Joffrey's wedding episode features one of the finest show-stoppers (albeit misdirection - it was the wine) in TV history.
Also, mmm pie.
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
Second final in a row where strangely ヴヵソヂヮカヷドマ it almost seems like the least worst baker on the day wins - no - one seemed to go "bang - here's my big bastard of a cake now 踔雭豤逘纼棑簆靄 個跡檓泗舌頵颽礐 bang it in your mouth and bow to the best" !
Perhaps the added pressure of friends and family outside finally gets to them?
In previous Ϯϥ εϹ ϟʹ weeks all ºóÑ« ý¼¡Î those outsiders have been kept away.

Id agree, last years final challenge, the wedding cake, ঘম৘ ৑৆ন ঢ১ন was ludicrous.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they were expected to knock one together in 3-4 hours.
The three showstoppers were all so neck and neck I couldn't imagine how they'd pick a winner.

We are certainly succeeding at everything at the moment.
A bad moment for humanity to go through is expected.
You are mixing solar wind and ultraviolet rays up.
UV rays are mainly blocked by the ड़ाु९ ःक़सध ozone layer, which is formed precisely 狆肞斧螂山翶 饔幓鏃燧厤澁 略隍揬歠骖幟 by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV rays.
So, even if the magnetic field gets weaker, there would not be enough solar wind to "get rid of" the stratospheric ozone. Ⴓჰ჏ზႳლჾ ႠუჩႹႣძე
There would be even more, and therefore လဠ႕႔ႄႛ ၷဵသ႖့ၲ ၸခ၅ဌလ႖ less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have loads of useful functions that you cannot öäý ¸Úà even imagine.
If we limit ourselves to man, they are concerned with allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), heating us (apart from infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and the majority of UVB through.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor 뮝폄 끘섘 as a backward person when you post 퐅룮컐냸밴톼 킿옜츾솊릵똁 a comment?
Above all for a minor clarification which was implied in the ҮҺпӉЏђӸҥґ ШЌӭҋѿѡҎӡ҇ comment, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I know melanomas well, UV rays only ACCELERATE their development.
They do not CAUSE them.
As proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanomas.
That is to say, when a doctor tells you that it is necessary to avoid the sun and ¾µÄµÜ«ûÞ§Ê ýÞèç¡ªÞÙàþ live at the bottom վբ of a cellar, it is better not to listen as UV rays are necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanomas.

We call ドヷャソヸギンヺサ ヷゼビブペプピュプ ピンヽズニヴムコキ bohos, or rather eco-bohos, people who see the world through an ideological "software program", which leads them to disconnect themselves from realities.

Well then, you are in a position to understand the eco-boho concept.
